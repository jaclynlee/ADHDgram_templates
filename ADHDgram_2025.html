          Hey friends! Happy first week of school to anyone celebrating. This week marks a shift into my fall work schedule. In many ways I’m thankful for the structure but transitions are *a challenge* for most ADHD people.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of my fall projects is — [gasp] — reviewing <em><a href="https://adhdhomestead.net/orderfromchaos/">Order from Chaos</a></em> and making an initial round of notes and edits for a revised second edition. (Yes, I am doing this in addition to trying to finish two new books.) Fortunately, I have yet to find any chapters I truly dislike or feel need massive edits. Woohoo! I think a round of gentle revisions and updates will bring the book into 2025 and keep it fresh for readers.
        </p>

        <p>
          That said, I’d love your help shaping this second edition. My work has always been about connecting with readers over shared experiences. <em>Order from Chaos</em> has already helped so many people. Your feedback will help me maximize its positive impact in years to come.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’ve read <em>Order from Chaos</em>, which parts felt most helpful? Was there anything that really didn’t land for you, or feels less relevant now?
        </p>

        <p>
          If you haven’t read it or you’d prefer a specific assignment, <a href="#ofc-chart">I’m including a chart below</a> that I’m considering updating. It holds social expectations up against our ADHD reality, but I worry it may not connect with Gen Z and younger Millennial readers.
        </p>

        <p>
          💡 Do any examples in the chart feel outdated? <br />
          💡 What would you add from your own life? Have you had to let any societal/familial expectations go in order to make your life work better?
        </p>

        <p>
          Don’t worry about having your thoughts in order. Even a single word or sentence helps! Just hit reply and <a href="https://adhdhomestead.net/feedback/">tell me what’s on your mind</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m really excited to hear your takes on this stuff. If you like seeing little snippets like this for feedback, please let me know even if you don’t have anything to say this time around. If I know y’all appreciate it, I’ll try to toss some more out there.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hope you’ve had a good summer so far, and that you have a fun project or two going as well.
        </p>

        <p>xoxo,</p>

        <h2>Shoulds vs. ADHD Reality</h2>
        <p>
          A version of this chart appears in <em>Order from Chaos</em>. See <a href="#introLetter">my letter above</a> if you need a reminder on the kind of feedback I'm looking for. I'd love to hear your thoughts, especially if you're under forty.

                Traveling with ADHD can be stressful, even without kids in the equation. The time we spend preparing and packing everyone up, not to mention the weekend away, eats into our family time and leaves no chance to catch up on anything around the house. Mom is retired and in good health. We need to talk to her about visiting us more often and make sure she feels welcome.

                People with ADHD generally dislike paperwork. Each new credit card brings its own set of upkeep responsibilities: reviewing and paying the bill each month, keeping an eye out for fraudulent transactions, handling the junk mail and email from these merchants, etc. Not only that, it’s easy to justify extra spending when we get special coupons and discounts. These cards may not be worth the cost to our time or our bank account.
