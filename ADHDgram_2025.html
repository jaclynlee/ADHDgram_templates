          Hey friends! Work on the second edition of Order from Chaos is plugging along. I‚Äôve finished the first pass of edits. Next step is to print out a copy of the manuscript for fact checking. If you‚Äôve followed me from the beginning you know I‚Äôm all about citing sources and giving credit. I want to make sure everything is still up to date and I‚Äôm being as thorough as the work deserves.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another big piece of work will be getting replacements for outdated graphics in the book. This leads me to my question of the month:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>If you read Order from Chaos in ebook or paperback, did you feel there were too many visuals, too few, or just right?</strong> Did you skip over any images? Was there anything you wished you could‚Äôve seen demonstrated visually on the page? Hit reply and let me know!
        </p>

        <p>
          Enough book talk for now. I want to say a few things about ADHD, hyperfocus, and social media. I watched some weird stuff go down on Threads this month. Outrage, conspiracies, attacks on people‚Äôs character, the whole bit.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, I love a little drama. As long as I‚Äôm not involved. I‚Äôm a drama spectator. It‚Äôs why I follow the NFL, and also why I subscribe to Lady Whistlethreads‚Äô weekly roundup of publishing-industry internet drama.
        </p>

        <p>
          What I don‚Äôt love is watching people get sucked into influence campaigns, disinformation, and comments-section arguments with bots. Yikes.
        </p>

        <p>
          It‚Äôs especially troubling because I see a lot of pressure to conform on social media. Every time we disagree with someone who has clout, try to introduce nuance, or express support for the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù public figure, we risk getting dragged. It takes very little to be labeled Problematic, and there‚Äôs very little an individual can do to dig themselves out of that hole once they fall in.
        </p>

        <p>
          I don‚Äôt want to resurrect any of the most insidious influence campaigns I‚Äôve seen online recently. If you know, you know. If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre lucky.
        </p>

        <p>
          I do want to say I worry about us ADHD people. I think about my history of social blunders, of trying to fit in and avoid making people mad at me. I also think about how easy it is for me still, today, to get swept up in the heat of the moment. Social media is designed to manipulate our brain‚Äôs reward pathways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our reward pathways are already compromised.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre more susceptible to the nefarious forces working on social media today, or more likely to get sucked into the latest manufactured drama, but common sense suggests we are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be careful out there, folks. More than ever, the internet is not real life. Just because something sounds serious on there does not mean it deserves to be taken seriously out here. Just because someone scolds you and tells you you‚Äôre wrong doesn‚Äôt mean you are wrong. (In case this isn‚Äôt obvious, sometimes it does.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Powerful people are benefiting from our distraction. Our hyperfocus. I don‚Äôt want to let them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let‚Äôs try to keep each other grounded ‚úåüèº
        </p>

        <p>xoxo,</p>
