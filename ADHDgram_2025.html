          Happy 2026! I hope you’re getting a breather after the holidays and digging into whatever you want to put your mind to this year.
        </p>

        <p>
          We had a whirlwind winter break and it got me thinking about *capacity*: how much we can do, how much we should do, and how we compare our own capacity to others’.
        </p>

        <p>
          A trainer at our gym often assigns us lifting sets not of a certain number of repetitions, but “until failure.” In other words, max out on each set.
        </p>

        <p>
          It took me a while to understand what “maxing out” or doing an exercise “until failure” meant. I’m a very literal person. This instruction inspires doubt after almost every set. Did I really max out? Could I have forced another rep? Did I push hard enough? Should I be proud and satisfied with my effort, or ashamed?
        </p>

        <p>
          However, hitting my maximum doesn’t have to mean getting pancaked under a squat bar. Sure, maybe my max on the pull-up bar means hanging at the bottom of a pull-up, unable to lift myself even an inch. But often it means doing an exercise until a point of muscle fatigue where I can no longer maintain proper form. I might technically be able to eke out another rep or two, but it wouldn’t look healthy or safe.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve been thinking about this concept as we barrel forward in time, into a new year. What does it mean to give my best effort? To max out?
        </p>

        <p>
          I think ADHD can cloud our perception of what good or appropriate effort looks like. In my case, I’ve always seen my work ethic as a core asset. I might be forgetful and impulsive. I might make stupid mistakes. My mind might go blank when you ask me a question about my area of expertise. But I’m a hard worker who will show up every day and put in my time.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also tend to doubt I’ve “earned” the luxury of rest. Part of this is how I was raised: don’t get caught with your feet up before your work is done. ADHD also plays into it with procrastination, forgetfulness, and avoidance. I’m often behind where I want to be on tasks. How can I rest when I have ground to make up?
        </p>

        <p>
          Add to that the fact that life with ADHD can require more energy than life without. My actual capacity often falls short of what I feel it should be.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet pushing harder and taking the desire to “max out” too literally can have the opposite effect. Just like it can cause injury, poor recovery, and slow progress in the weight room, it can lead to burnout and frayed relationships in real life.
        </p>
        <p>
          This year holds a lot of exciting plans and opportunities for me. I want to take full advantage. For me, that means putting in my best effort while also protecting my energy. Going until it becomes wise to stop. Stopping before I hit full burnout or meltdown stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve been there before, exhilarated by (too much) hard work only to burn myself out and battle reduced capacity for months afterward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another year older, I define “maxing out” differently than I used to. Now it feels more like finding the edge, the point of greatest effort before I can no longer do it *right*. My final rep with proper form, not my final rep before something breaks.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we move into 2026, I hope you’ll consider this distinction too. The world needs our best effort not just this week, but all the weeks after it. We can only do that when we respect our limits and rest before we hit a wall.
        </p>
