          *Thank you* to everyone who replied to last month’s newsletter with feedback for the Order from Chaos second edition. Your words mean a lot and your perspective is so helpful.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to revisiting Order from Chaos I’ve been buried in work for <a href="https://dothething.app">DoTheThing.app</a>. In true ADHD fashion, I get a lot of motivation from Apple’s big September update every year. It’s a great kick in the pants to finish improvements I’ve been putting off.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had a work retreat with my friend at the end of August. The timing was perfect to turn up my hyperfocus and tackle a huge update. Without getting into the weeds with details, I completely revamped how data gets passed around within the app. Kind of intimidating. Also, perfectly suited to those few days almost totally sequestered from the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          I talk about hyperfocus in <em>Order from Chaos</em> — about how it’s a double-edged sword, something that can hurt us as much as it helps us. Mine helped me make massive progress that week. It also fried my brain. Coming home from my retreat, I somehow got on the wrong train in Philadelphia. It was at least three days before I felt my cognitive abilities start to return to normal (my version).
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve seen this pattern play out before. Work in the final rounds of developmental edits for my novel <em>She’s Not Home</em> was exhilarating and all-consuming. The burnout after I turned in my final manuscript lasted for *months*. Like a nasty hangover, these burnout periods remind me why I need to be careful chasing the thrill of overindulgence.
        </p>

        <p>
          This most recent experience got me thinking: I’ve always felt a bit hesitant and skeptical around hyperfocus. Like other forms of overindulgence, I dislike the out-of-control feeling I get from it. I want every experience to feel, if not completely intentional, at least like a place I’m choosing to remain and can leave when it feels right.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, some people with ADHD — I know this because I live with them — lean into the hyperfocus. They crave those hours when they can be themselves and just let their brains go.
        </p>

        <p>
          What does that mean for our cognitive function? Is my tendency to burn out in proportion to my extended hyperfocus a me problem, or is it a universal problem, the way anyone’s performance will drop off if they fail to rest between sets at the gym? Does a certain degree of habitual hyperfocus leave us mentally fatigued and less equipped to self-regulate and perform when we need to?
        </p>

        <p>
          Maybe. When my kid was younger I tried to keep him from doing *anything* engaging — screen time, but also reading and Legos — for more than two hours at a stretch. Otherwise when he finally did break out of the zone he’d have zero self-regulation, often a complete meltdown.
        </p>
        <p>
          The older I get, the more I view my mental energy and abilities the same way I do physical ones. I listen to my physical therapist, who tells me I will get stronger faster if I include real rest days in my weekly routine. I also listen to my brain when it short-circuits and rushes me onto the wrong train at the end of an intense work week.
        </p>
        <p>
          It can feel good to hit it hard in the moment, but the hangover is real. The risk of injury and mental lapses, also real.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes taking care of myself is walking away before something forces me to. I don’t need hyperfocus to be a superpower — especially if moderation will get me on the right train at the end of a long week.
        </p>

        <p>xoxo,</p>

        <h2>The app for people (or at least this person) who give up on productivity apps</h2>
        <p>
          In 2019 I decided to make a to-do list app because the exact to-do list app I wanted did not exist. While I don’t recommend this path to everyone, it has turned into a super fulfilling side project. I’m really proud of how much I’ve learned and what I’ve been able to build. Built on my implementation of David Allen’s Getting Things Done system, Do The Thing truly holds my life together at this point.

          <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1478425109">Do The Thing 2025.06 is available in the App Store now</a> and I daresay it’s the best incarnation of the app yet. If you’re on iPhone I’d love for you to check it out and let me know what you think. Also, if you’d be interested in occasional app giveaways like I do with my books, let me know that too! I have access to App Store promo codes and could include them in future raffles.
