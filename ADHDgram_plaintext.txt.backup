Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

As I write this, I'm on the cusp of an act so out-of-character, people close to me might wonder if I'm okay. Alternatively, they might feel relieved I'm finally taking their advice.

I'm seizing an opportunity for last-minute travel plans.

I generally dislike last-minute anything. However, this is the last week of summer vacation and I have an opportunity to take my kiddo for three last beach days and the surf forecast looks terrible but very much open to delusion. For once I managed to ask myself: is it possible I will look back years from now and say, "my life would have turned out so much better if I'd skipped those extra three days at the beach?"

Highly unlikely. Like, eaten-by-a-shark-and-struck-by-lightning-on-the-same-day unlikely.

I don't have any big ADHD advice or revelations for you this month. If you're anything like me, you're feeling overwhelmed and behind on preparation for the upcoming change of seasons and routines. Nobody needs anything more to process right now.

However, I will say this: some of my resistance to last-minute fun activities is just who I am. Recently I was invited to join a trip to the pool or something similarly low-key in my neighborhood. I actually had to say, "I will be excited about this but I need a few minutes to get used to the idea of my day looking different than I expected." That's me being me and it's not going to change.

Sometimes, though, I don't think I've earned it. Or I think it's irresponsible. Or both.

This short trip to the beach falls under the latter. And you know what? It is irresponsible. There are a hundred other things I should be doing.

But they can wait. My grandmother used to tell me, "I was a terrible housekeeper because if I had to choose between scrubbing the floors and taking the kids to the pool, I always took them to the pool."

Too many such choices and I will have a meltdown about the house, but too few and I will miss out on experiences I'll never get back. I want my kid to remember me taking him to dig in the sand. I want to remember afternoons spent bodysurfing with my dad.

Have I earned this little caper? Absolutely not. And I'm thankful that for once, I've realized that's not the point and done it anyway. 

xoxo,

Jaclyn

** Last call for the Order from Chaos workshop! **

If you want in on our fall workshop, now is the time to register!

The Order from Chaos workshop is a space to get to know ourselves, figure out why our past attempts to get organized have failed, and craft our own methods for organizing our lives -- systems that mold to fit *us*, not the other way around.

We'll share our own real-life experiences, answer questions, and do some Zoom show-and-tell to celebrate organizing and decluttering successes. If you know, you know: sometimes those small wins mean everything to us. It's lovely to be part of a group who gets it.

I've had *tons of fun* in our demo workshops this summer and can't wait to hang with more of you in the fall. You can join the workshop as a companion to or replacement for reading the book -- this is basically it in conversational form, with a bunch of new friends.

I'm hosting two sessions this fall:
* Thursday evenings at 7:30 p.m. Eastern, September 2 - October 14: www.eventbrite.com/e/159513291549/?discount=ADHDgram-DCJQVMEB
* Saturday mornings at 9:30 a.m. Eastern, September 11 - October 30: www.eventbrite.com/e/159519127003/?discount=ADHDgram-DCJQVMEB

These links will automatically apply a 10% discount at checkout. If you answered my interest survey last fall, look for a special email with an additional discount!
