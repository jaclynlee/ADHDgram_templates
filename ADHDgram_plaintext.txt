In this issue:
* Do it...or cause it to be done
* How to support my work
========================================================

Let's talk responsibilities -- specifically, what it means to be responsible for a regular chore or task.

I serve as President of the Board for a small community group. We recently got a new Secretary. As I listed out their responsibilities, I told them not to be overwhelmed. "You don't have to do all these things," I said. "You're just in charge of making sure someone does them."

For example: according to our bylaws, the Secretary must "announce or cause to be announced" the dates for upcoming public meetings. We have volunteers (not the Secretary) who handle meeting announcements.

This conversation got me thinking: many of us think being responsible for something means we have to do it.

Several months ago I delegated responsibility for the upstairs bathroom to my husband. I don't think he'll mind me telling you, it has not gone well. Part of this is because we have different standards of cleanliness, but part of it is also ADHD. He has, on plenty of weekends, intended to clean the bathroom and just...not.

I'm sure you can relate -- if not with cleaning the bathroom (congrats if so), then with some other chore intent on slipping the mind.

Last weekend I approached my husband about the bathroom. I told him, look, you may be responsible for the bathroom, but I really don't care who cleans it. Being responsible means you need to *clean or cause to be cleaned*.

This could mean paying a cleaning service to come every month or two to help with catch-up. It could also mean training our kid and delegating the chore to him.

No one will give you an award for doing everything yourself.

If you have the resources (or the tween in search of video game privileges) to outsource a chore you've consistently failed to keep under control...do it.

Free up that mental space for something else.

Something that will bring more benefit to you and the world.

A lot of us in the Northern Hemisphere experience an energy boost this time of year (if we aren't hobbled by allergies). Maybe we even aspire to a little spring cleaning.

My question is: can you find any areas of responsibility where you could either *do something* or *cause it to be done* with the same end result?

Is there a way to make that happen, if not with money than with an exchange of skills or other resources?

Why not go for it? Go in peace and *cause it to be done*.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
