In this issue:
* What if it's actually okay?
* How to support my work
========================================================

I'm sending my June newsletter in July, and let's just put the question out there: what if it's actually fine?

I've asked this many times over the past year or so. The first time came when I was nit-picking something about my body, or probably more specifically, how my clothes fit on and around it.

I interrupted my self-critical train of thought with, Yeah but what if it's actually fine? What if my body is healthy and strong, and that is more than good enough?

This may sound a little unhinged, but what if that thing you're obsessing about isn't actually a problem?

And yes, I get it, I have the impulsive strain of ADHD and thus have in my life done things that are objectively Not Fine. If we act irresponsibly, harm another person, something like that, then yes, we ought to atone for that and do what we can to make it right.

The other weekend I was out climbing with a group of women and caught myself apologizing after I took what felt like an eternity figuring out a tricky section of a route. In my mind I'd taken too much time and attention. I'd taken too long to come down and give someone else a turn on that route.

You may be shocked to hear, it was actually fine. The rest of the group would've been bummed if I'd given up without finishing the route. I'd worked so hard! I was so close to the top! Not a single person would've thanked me for taking up less time and space in that moment.

And yet this is something I struggle with, having grown up as that ADHD kid who often felt like (or was outright told) I took up too much air in the room. It's hard to take the time and space I need, especially if that time and space requires something of another person.

Look, I get actually having things to apologize for. Believe me. But I think that can also work against us. Sometimes we think we need to apologize for *everything*. We think every problem we can see, is as much a problem as it appears through our eyes.

Sometimes it's just not.

I'll never feel one hundred percent satisfied with myself. But do I want to? Being a work in progress is a core part of my life experience.

Most of us hold ourselves to a way higher standard than we would ever apply to the people we love.

What if we're doing the best we can with what we have right now, and that is actually fine?

xoxo,

Jaclyn
