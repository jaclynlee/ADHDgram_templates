Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

This month I've talked a lot about down time. The need for down time has stayed front and center in my mind because I a.) didn't give myself any in December and b.) had to very intentionally correct this in January.

I had a big deadline this month. A writing project into which I poured nearly fifty hours of work.

This required a lot of time deep in my hyperfocus zone. Because I'm an author and I happen to enjoy writing, this felt really satisfying. Despite cramming all fifty hours into one month instead of multiple thanks to an earlier hyperfocus bender, life felt mostly healthy and balanced.

I credit this not to spending every waking hour locked into this project, as I did in December's escapades, but to doing the opposite of that.

This required me to change my work routines. Every day I could, I started my work day with my daily words. Sometimes this meant I shortchanged other work. Forty percent of my time in the office this month was spent on a single writing project. Some tasks languished and will get done in February.

By prioritizing starting my workday with this mammoth project, I usually met my word count goal before dinner. I stood up and left my desk around 5:00.

And I didn't go back.

I also wrote in my habit hearts goals for every week this month: engage in a leisure activity. This could be as simple as sitting on the couch and reading a magazine. Many days, I played the piano after dinner. I took a cue from the rest of my family and angled for a turn on the Nintendo Switch.

On January 27, I experienced a strange sensation.

I'd settled on the couch to read a novel at 7:00 on a Thursday evening. This felt very indulgent. Definitely enough to color in my leisure time habit heart for that day.

But in addition to the satisfaction of checking a box on a daily habit goal, I also felt a distinct pleasure. I'd worked hard that day. And now I was indulging in a favorite activity at a time when I could've been doing something more productive, but had decided not to. It felt right and good and nourishing. My typical restlessness was replaced with its rarer counterpart: contentment.

I truly believe my commitment to down time and leisure activities kept my brain sharp enough to plow through the nearly 97,000 words I had on my plate. I met my deadline without burning out because I tended to my energy needs. But toward the end of the month I also began enjoying that down time more.

Perhaps, then, this is a skill like anything else. It took twenty-six straight days of practice before I finally hit my stride. A sort of leisure time flow state, where I felt like I was really appreciating it.

If there is hope for me in this arena, I truly believe there is hope for anyone. If you're having trouble enjoying the breaks you give yourself, I would humbly suggest taking more opportunities to practice. All hyperfocus and no rest will indeed make a mushy brain. This much I know from experience.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
