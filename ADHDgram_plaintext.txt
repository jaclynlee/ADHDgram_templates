Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

Last week I had a bit of a meltdown about the state of our house. I've gotten behind on my regular cleaning and tidying, which feels super overwhelming because I know I can't fix it tomorrow. It's going to take time.

ADHD doesn't like time. It especially doesn't like time when time means waiting for a reward sometime in the future. That might as well be never!

Demands on my time have also increased as we become able to see much of our family again for the first time since Christmas 2019.

Typing this now, it feels obvious: of course we should prioritize seeing people we love. Of course I have nothing to show for myself after over a year of pandemic life: no DIY projects, no renovations, only a house that's nowhere near as clean as when we started. I've been juggling household responsibilities, virtual school (which is still happening), and my own work.

As I think about catching up on all this, I also think: what about my leisure reading time? What about my gardens? What about, what about, what about.

It's a lot.

I say this because I suspect some of you are feeling the same way. And it's okay. We'll be okay.

Really.

Our ADHD working memory doesn't really allow most of us to hold all this in our heads at one time without getting overwhelmed. We lack that natural ability to put it in perspective. It ends up feeling like a big overwhelming mess that will never get better.

(This is why even as early as middle school, I learned I need to start writing lists when I feel this way. Pen and paper stand in for my brain's working memory.)

It will get better. Little by little. I've been reminding myself of that by finding little wins to celebrate. The other day, I carried a box upstairs that had been sitting in the living room for the past month. It felt good, like a weight lifted from my shoulders. Little things. Little wins.

If you're feeling overwhelmed by the changing pace of our lives right now, I'm right there with you. Let's all give ourselves some small wins over the next week. If you want to reply and tell me yours, I'm always listening!

Take it easy,

Jaclyn

** Order from Chaos audiobook available now!!! **

After so many of you have asked for an audiobook edition of Order from Chaos (https://adhdhomestead.net/orderfromchaos/), I'm delighted to announce: it's here! You can get it wherever you buy your audiobooks.

Also, I have a favor to ask: if your library system loans audiobooks through a service like Overdrive, please hop over to their catalog, search for Jaclyn Paul, then request Order from Chaos if they don't already own it. For our library, it's as easy as clicking a big "recommend" button in the search results! Purchase requests let the library know there's interest in a book, and can help make it more accessible to folks who can't afford Audible.

** Order from Chaos Virtual Workshop Demos begin **
This month, ADHD Homestead patrons (https://www.patreon.com/ADHDhomestead?filters[tag]=OFC%20workshop%20demos) started demo-ing early sessions of my upcoming Order from Chaos Personal Organizing Workshop. We met for Session Two on Saturday and it was an absolute delight.

I'm really excited to make this happen and hang out with all of you "in person!" Other -- ahem -- life factors have made development of this idea slow going, but we're getting there. After these demos, I'll open up registration to my ADHDgram friends (that's you!). Keep an eye on this newsletter in the coming months!
