In this issue:
* Why is it hard for me to try hard?
* Mental load and "notice and do"
========================================================

Last month I told you all I'd registered for a twelve-hour climbing endurance competition. This decision was, you may have guessed, made impulsively and without full consideration of the long-term effects.

Well, I'm happy to report I survived! I also did not seriously injure myself. I did aggravate a tightness in my right bicep that occasionally likes to remind me of that surgery I put off and only got when I my shoulder was in such bad shape I couldn't lift my arm. It'll be fine. That this is the only lingering physical damage feels like a victory.

I did not win my category, nor did I rise above the middle of the pack, but I learned a lot. Mentally and physically, the day was A Journey. I think I did well taking breaks at reasonable intervals, fueling with the right food at the right times, and pushing my limits without doing anything unnecessarily dangerous.

I also tried hard. We had to enter with a partner who we'd climb with exclusively during the competition. I'm a competitive person in general, but I'm also loyal and never want to let my team down. I wanted to give this competition my best and lean into the strengths I brought to the table.

This can feel very vulnerable. Trying hard in public, I mean.

I've been thinking about that vulnerability in the context of ADHD for a few months now. It can be scary to show the world what it actually looks like when we try hard. In both myself and my kid, I see a tendency to clown around in a group, to joke about being "bad at" things and make excuses to work below our potential.

In other words, making a commitment to try my best in front of everyone, at an activity I am emotionally invested in, with a teammate counting on me, was a big deal. Even though the whole thing was also fun and casual. I'm proud of myself for doing it at all, and also for doing it on a pretty even keel.

I wonder: what makes it so hard to show the world what it looks like when we try hard at something that matters? Is it all those times people accused our younger selves of "not trying hard enough," or "not caring," when we were actually doing our best? Is it the mistakes we can't seem to eliminate, even from the things we least want to screw up? Does failure feel less embarrassing when we allow others to believe we didn't give it our all?

I'm curious: do any of you experience anxiety and reluctance to show your actual best effort to others? What is this like for you? Why do you think it happens?

I don't have any more answers than I did a month ago, but I think there's a lot of value in asking the questions.

xoxo,

** Something I'm thinking about this month: "Notice and Do" vs. assigned chores **

Once upon a time, I used to make chore lists for my kid during school breaks. He would (and still does) invariably whine about these lists and insist I was overburdening him. Did I expect him to spend every second of the day working? Did I not realize how limited his free time was already?

Look, I'm not going to do my whole kids-these-days, old-person-shouting-at-the-clouds thing here. Even though I want to. The reality is, handing a big list of chores to an ADHD person with impaired time perception and working memory doesn't always go smoothly.

During a recent school break I had zero mental capacity to make him a list so I just told the kid he needed to complete one "Notice and Do" for every hour of approved screen time. I learned the concept of Notice and Do from Sam Kelly on Instagram/Threads (https://www.instagram.com/samkelly_world/). It is pretty much what the name implies: you notice something that needs to be done around the house, and you do it.

The result? My son completed more housework than if I'd given him a list. Within a few days our home's shared spaces were tidy and his desk was usable for the first time in months. He also didn't complain about doing the work, and I didn't waste mental energy coming up with a to-do list or harassing him about said list.

That little bit of extra autonomy helped him feel in control. Managing the flow of tasks also means managing the overwhelm.

But there's another important point here, and that is: he won't always have me to make a list. Nor do I want him to grow into an adult who needs his partner to give him a list. In fact, I'd love not to have to make him a list even now. For a person with ADHD and too much on my plate, delegation can feel almost as overwhelming as just doing the stuff myself. Having another person in the house empowered to notice and do without my intervention is truly a blessing.
