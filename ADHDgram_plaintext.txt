* More small wins
* Books n stuff
* Thank you
========================================================

Hey friends! I had a whole different letter written for today, but I'm scrapping it -- or at least saving it for later -- because I want to talk about small wins.

Yes, again.

Because sometimes, small wins are everything.

I've been rationing my meds this week because they're backordered and I haven't had the wherewithal to mount a search for hidden stock. This means things are hard. Work I really value and want to do is hard.

Add to that, it's summer vacation and our family's schedules are in flux. My work life is also in flux. This is intentional, and planned, but still. Transitions are hard.

Yesterday I needed a small win.

After lunch I felt tempted to go straight back to the office and try to buckle down. However, "buckling down" is both an imaginary and an overly optimistic solution, to put it generously. Fortunately I realized this and set out for a walk instead.

Not only that, I turned it into a delivery walk. I deposited hand-me-downs on two separate neighbors' porches on my way out. Then I walked down to the local family center to drop off a donation. I'd previously cleaned out under our bathroom sink and identified one bag each of surplus toothbrushes, travel size toothpastes, and flosses/flossers. The family center was delighted to take them from me, and I was delighted to be rid of some of the "to donate" items I've accumulated around the house.

This specific chore always triggers a disproportionate sense of lightness and capability when I cross it off the list. It's not a big deal -- just dropping off some toothbrushes, an old pair of hiking pants, and a box of band aids I can't use -- and yet it is a big deal. When I struggle to get to this stuff, it can trigger a lot of shame and overwhelm.

Which is exactly why I needed to turn it into a win.

It was probably the least urgent task I could've completed. Certainly less so than finishing this newsletter, for example. But in that moment, it was the most important. It was the key to coming back home, sitting down and my desk, and feeling like a person capable of doing things.

Things like finishing this newsletter, which I may not have done without that walk.

If you're struggling right now, look for a small win to boost your spirits. You might need it more than you know.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
