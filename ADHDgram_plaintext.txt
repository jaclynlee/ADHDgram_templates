Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

Iâ€™m going to try to keep this letter short. Iâ€™ve felt a little quiet lately. Weâ€™re still adjusting to summer vacation despite July being upon us. Everyone has a lot on their minds, Iâ€™m sure.

This morning we said goodbye to some special neighbors as they embarked on a long-distance move. The kids ran around outside and rode their scooters and when we came in, mine collapsed. Usually so loud and chatty I feel like Iâ€™m shushing him every three minutes, now he could barely talk or stand. He said he felt sick, dizzy, and shaky.

The poor soul has inherited my proclivity for profuse sweating in the heat---and also getting caught up in the moment. Sometimes we donâ€™t hear our bodies sending a message until all the emergency bells are ringing.

After bidding our friends farewell, I spent the rest of my morning not getting a late start to the workday, but sitting on the hardwood floor in our upstairs hallway, keeping my kiddo company while he laid on the cool bathroom tile sipping Gatorade (many thanks to another neighbor for having some we could borrow in a pinch!). I explained to him (again) about heat and dehydration and how sweat depletes our bodies of water and salt.

Hopefully heâ€™ll remember to take a water bottle outside with him next time.

It can be hard sometimes, and especially now, to take a pause. Check in with ourselves. Rest. Give our minds and bodies the nourishment they need.

But we need to. If we ignore those simple acts of self-care for too long, we begin to shut down.

I hope you take some time to take care of yourself this week. (And donâ€™t forget to drink plenty of water.)

Be well,
Jaclyn

Join me for a reading and virtual book event on July 15 ðŸ“š

Immediately pre-pandemic I was planning a modest book tour. Imagining a route that took me from Pennsylvania to Maine to Illinois to California to Florida.

Obviously that wonâ€™t happen anytime soon.

I hesitated to go all-virtual. I still really want to visit those places and their indie bookshops. However, while weâ€™re waiting I teamed up with our own Ivy Bookshop here in Baltimore for a virtual reading and book event on July 15.

The silver lining here is youâ€™re all invited! I canâ€™t wait to (virtually) hang with all of you on July 15. Click below for more details and if you want some sneak previews beforehand, I plan to post some sample readings on the Patreon.

Some ruminations on ADHD struggles and privilege ðŸ¤”

Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot lately bout the lenses many of us use to view our ADHD stories. Weâ€™ve all struggled, to some extent. And yet it doesnâ€™t take anything away from my struggles, or the work I did to overcome them, to say I benefited from privilege. To say the family I came from, the place I lived, and the color of my skin all contributed a lot to my ADHD story.

I started to explore that a bit in a recent post that was supposed to be about report cards, but ended up being about something else.
