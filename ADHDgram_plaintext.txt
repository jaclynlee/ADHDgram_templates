Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

As I hit send on this email, we're about to head into the final three weeks of summer vacation. Kids here go back to school the last week of August. Three weeks is, depending how one looks at it, a full quarter of the summer or nothing at all.

The past several weeks have felt like a huge time warp. It's like I stepped through a doorway and came out two months in the future. I could blame this on feeling ADHD Extra these past few months, or on having too many high-stakes deadlines, or on our family's schedule changing weekly. However, nothing changes the reality, which is that for me, time has hurtled forward at terrifying speeds.

The other day -- a Saturday -- I was frantically rushing around, feeling pulled in a hundred different directions, when I had to tell myself out loud to stop. Stop. Think. What's important? What's next?

And I've tried to keep that question of "What's important?" in the front of my mind.

One afternoon my kiddo was begging me to play catch as I struggled to wrap up some work before dinner. At first I put him off. Then I asked myself, what am I really going to accomplish with this five minutes? Is this really the most important five minutes of my day?

It wasn't. I stood up from my desk and told him I only had a few minutes before I needed to start dinner. I started a timer to help us stay on track. He bounded outside and grabbed a ball for us to throw. For five minutes, we laughed and ran around the yard and played catch.

This probably sounds cliche but it kind of did end up being the most important five minutes of my day. The simple joy on my kid's face confirmed I'd made the right choice. Nothing else I did with those five minutes could've had more impact.

It's so easy for me to get flustered and convince myself I need to get one more thing done, or if I just buckle down for five more minutes I'll feel like I made the best of my day. And sometimes I do need to push myself! But other times I need to pause and ask myself what's actually important.

Yes, staying afloat with my must-do tasks is important. But so is taking a break every once in a while to remind the people around me they are important, too. It's so easy to get distracted and forget to make the small gestures, but those gestures make all the difference.

If you're deep in the weeds like I am, I hope you'll give yourself a break, literally and figuratively. Also, it's never too late to offer a slice of your precious time and focus to show someone who need to know they matter (this includes yourself!)

xoxo,

Jaclyn
