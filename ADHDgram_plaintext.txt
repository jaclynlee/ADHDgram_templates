Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

I'm sending an extra one of these in April to make up for the one I missed in March. What is a week, anyway?

(While I don't have a quantitative answer to this question -- at least not one that translates to ADHD-world -- I can tell you last week, for me, was both a lot and a little. I hope this week is neither, but we aren't even halfway through it yet.)

I've been thinking about time and transitions, and how hard they are for ADHD folks.

Last week I had a huge project due on Friday and my kid's birthday on Saturday. The preceding days turned into a mess. I misjudged, by orders of magnitude, how much time and work my deadline would require. My husband fell ill with a cold we'd mostly shrugged off, but which took him out for the entire week. I accepted help from neighbors with school drop-off (usually his job) and told myself the house didn't need to be clean for an outdoor party. Still, my head was swimming.

Through it all, I worked obsessively on my project. I allowed myself to (over)focus for longer periods of time than usually feels healthy. When I left my desk to make dinner, my body arrived in the kitchen but my brain was still transitioning from deep in my writing world. I felt disoriented. I struggled to find words for everyday things when talking to my family. People asked how it was going, how I was doing, and I honestly didn't know. I was deep in it. The big picture didn't exist.

I finally submitted the finished project at 7:14 on Friday evening and dove into birthday party preparations. By the time guests arrived just after 1:00 on Saturday afternoon, I had a table of snacks out and two coolers, aptly labeled "beer" and "not beer." A modest success I appreciated deeply.

Maybe some of you will understand how I felt on Sunday: low-energy. Directionless. Fighting a persistent discontent that seemed to lack both source and remedy.

So I went outside to dig in the dirt for a while. I dug out hops and lilies from around my rose and sage bushes, and was astounded by the diameter of the hops' main root. A grateful neighbor adopted some of the hops. I poured new topsoil around the sage. Hours later, I cleaned up my tools under the setting sun. My muscles were sore and my thoughts had settled.

As I combed roots of centipede grass and lilies away from my rose bush with a weeding tool, I realized what had brought me outside. It was a transition. After such prolonged, intense use of my focusing (mental) muscles, I needed some time in the dirt to help me reset and prepare for what came next.

However you may feel about ADHD hyperfocus, a lot of us struggle to transition out of it. This makes sense to me because we struggle with transitions in general. I even get irritable about driving places I feel are too close to home. I will gladly walk in rainy or frigid weather, rather than manage rapid-fire transitions between walking, driving, and parking.

This is a transitional time. I haven't found any magic techniques to fast-forward the process. For a lot of us, changes in seasons, significant endings or beginnings, or simply going from sitting in the car to carrying a bag into a building can be challenging. It just is what it is.

I have, however, found it very helpful to know the cause of my irritable, scattered, or unsettled feelings. Never underestimate the power of self-awareness.

How about you? What transitions do you find especially rankling? Hit reply and let me know -- maybe I need to write a whole blog post on this topic!

xoxo,

Jaclyn
