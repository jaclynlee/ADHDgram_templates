I had another letter written for this month (actually last month because I forgot to send an April newsletter, even though I told you I'm making an extra effort to be more consistent about this newsletter, but I digress). However, recent events call for a change of topic.

It's time for another letter about What to Do When Life Goes Sideways.

It's hard for us ADHD (or even regular) people to keep our heads on straight when life becomes unpredictable. Structure and routine are a big part of how I manage my ADHD. Uncertainty is...not.

When things got all screwy recently, I aggressively did three things:
 1. Reduced work expectations
 2. Maintained exercise/restorative activity expectations
 3. Deleted every single email I could get away with deleting, even if I wanted to read it

Yes, that included emails for which I pay a subscription fee.

It just wasn't happening. Any of it.

I also swiped away a lot, and I mean a lot, of news and social notifications on my phone.

The world won't end if we miss something. If it's really important, it'll come around again.

During my couple weeks in low grade crisis mode I only worked as much as I absolutely had to, no more. I skipped optional evening meetings. I *did not* skip my normal exercise days at the gym. I *did* meet up with a climbing buddy for a low-key outdoor session. I also went to a few extra yoga classes and refused to feel bad when I bailed on an evening meeting to watch Ted Lasso with my family.

As a result, I came out of the acute phase of the crisis feeling healthy and relatively sane and not terribly behind on my email inbox.

Look, maybe twenty years ago I would've been energized by crisis mode. At this point I understand my grasp on order and sanity can be rather tenuous. My ability to focus on normal work while also managing a capital-S Situation and knowing I could be interrupted at any moment is...minimal at best.

I'm also responsible for taking care of and showing up for other people in my life. If me and my ADHD brain want to be able to do that, we need to put our own oxygen mask on first.

For me, that means removing non-essential demands to keep space for the things that keep me functional (most often music, working out, and climbing with my friends). I once thought having a brain that scrambled in all directions meant I could do it all. I haven't thought that in a long time. At least since 2020.

When times get tough, ask yourself what's actually important. Like, *important* important. What will keep your gears turning. Who you want to show up for (including yourself). You might like all the other stuff, but sometimes you have to toss it out until the storm recedes.

Make sense? Do you have self-preservation strategies like this? Or wish you did? It was a skill I lacked until the pandemic forced the issue.

xoxo,

Jaclyn

** Join me on some ADHD podcasts! **

In the midst of all the weirdness of the past few weeks, not one but two podcast episodes dropped where I am the guest. We talk about parenthood, organizing and sharing space with others, ADHD family life, and more.

Both were fun conversations and I'd be flattered if you gave them a listen!
