Hey friends! I've been deep in the work cave for the past couple months. It feels good to take a moment to write you a Leap Day hello.

I began today with a series of mishaps and silly mistakes. Starting a batch of bread only to realize I'd used the last bag of flour from the pantry and failed to write it on the grocery list. Getting to the grocery store thirty-five minutes before it opened and having to go to a different store instead. Realizing I forgot my wallet and keys. Compensating for this oversight by using Apple Pay on my phone, but still having to wait outside in the cold until my husband got home to let me into the house. Dumping the flour into a bowl with water and noticing just in time, I'd forgotten to add the sourdough starter.

ADHD things, mostly.

Now I've settled (more or less) at my desk for the day. I hope to make the best of my productive time but life offers no guarantees.

The other day at the gym I started my climbing session off all wrong. Clumsy, off-balance, prone to goofy mistakes. At some point I made a conscious decision to accept it. We can't crush it every day.

Instead, I told myself to make it a "continuity day." Focus on spending time on the wall, keeping muscle memory. Choose easier climbs. Don't try to break any personal records.

After that, I had one of my best sessions ever.

Who knows how much mindset played into this, but I took it as a lesson. When I let go of expectations -- I need to make the most of this work day, I need to continue progressing with my climbing -- I have a much easier time letting the inevitable mishaps go.

That's not to say I love how this morning went, or I see no room for improvement. But most of my mornings actually go okay. If I fixate on turning things around, or compensating for the time I lost going to the wrong store and getting locked out of the house, the stakes on every minute feel higher. If I latch onto the idea of snapping out of a weird start at the gym and climbing to my full potential, each climb gets too important.

If I move forward from this moment with a clean slate, I have more space to do my best.

ADHD things will happen. Interruptions and disruptions and mishaps completely outside our control will happen, too.

They happen even when we do our best.

With that in mind, let's keep our eyes on the road ahead.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
