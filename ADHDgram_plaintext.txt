Dear friends,

I've been thinking a lot about self-awareness lately. Sometimes I go through a time that feels like ADHD overdrive. This isn't always a bad thing. It's not always a good thing, either.

My most recent "ADHD overdrive" came in the form of extended hyperfocus. A new project provided gave me an outlet for a certain creative energy that's felt stifled by pandemic life. That's the good news.

The bad news, which is also kind of good news, is I let it take over my entire brain. For two weeks, I hardly worked on anything else. This ADHD energy can bring a lot to a team, but at some point I had to pause and wait for others to catch up. I got restless and cranky. I also had no idea what to do with my time because I'd lost touch with everything I'd been working on before this project fell into my lap.

Depending on your perspective, you might consider this an ADHD "superpower," or you might find it wholly exasperating.

For me, it comes down to control. Most of us want to feel in control of our lives. Like we have choices.

For once, I didn't beat myself up over this hyperfocus spell or its aftermath. I'd made a choice. I felt the hyperfocus taking over at the beginning, felt things getting intense, and decided to let it go.

When I had to break the hyperfocus, I made my peace with that too. I acknowledged the lethargy, restlessness, fatigue, and resistance to other work.

This, I told myself, was not a character flaw or a display of weakness. It was a natural rebound from a time of intense, single-minded focus. My brain needed time to recover, and I needed to be okay with that.

When I talk about the necessity of "treating" and "managing" our ADHD, I don't mean we should cram it into a box. We don't need to make ourselves neurotypical-equivalent -- and nor should we! But many ADHDers suffer when we feel out of control. When the hyperfocus, the big roller-coaster emotions, the anxiety and unreliability, just happen to us. We feel swallowed up.

But we want a choice: we want to shape our lives, to decide how we show up in the world.

With time, I've learned to recognize what's happening in my brain and decide how to react. I will never be perfect at it. However, what once felt impossible now feels slightly closer to my grasp. I've said this a lot lately, but we don't need to be in control all the time. Even being able to *recognize what's happening*, to give it a name, to observe ourselves a little more clearly, can make all the difference in the world.

Self-awareness is a skill most of us struggle mightily with. It's also one of our most worthy pursuits.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
