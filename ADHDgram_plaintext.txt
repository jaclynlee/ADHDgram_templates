========================================================

Hello friends! Sorry I disappeared all summer. It happens, right?

Our summer has been both fun and full of adventure and...challenging.

Because ADHD.

Between vacations, my kid's day camps, and who knows what else, our family's schedule and rhythm changes every week. Every year this reminds me how much my cognitive functioning depends on consistency and routine.

I recently received a book deadline and I'm fighting background anxiety that I won't have what it takes to do this project. Said anxiety is probably unfounded, but that's never stopped me from worrying before.

Also, it's tough to feel security and certainty about the future when you can't predict how well your brain will be functioning. How close to your potential you'll be able to operate.

If you're feeling this way, or have in the past, know you are not alone.

Between the last ADHDgram and today I have:

 * Watched my child graduate from elementary school
 * Ridden a horse for the first time
 * Gone climbing outside twice
 * Lost all my blackjack money in Atlantic City, then won it all back
 * Spent several days at the beach with my dad and my son
 * Vacationed in the Colorado Rockies and hiked up to 12,000 feet
 * Moved my website and email servers to new providers
 * Gotten my productivity app, Do The Thing, almost ready for its App Store debut
 * Taken the train from Baltimore to Maine to visit my childhood best friend
 * Finally got a contractor out to fix the mold-stained, crumbling grout in my upstairs bathroom

This is a lot! I have a lot planned for the fall but it feels different. My sometimes-crazy work schedule will wrap around my household's stable school and work routines. For the first time in months, next week will feel like a known quantity.

You can have a fantastic summer and still feel completely exhausted and ready for it to end. This is one hundred percent what I'm feeling. I've mourned my intellectual capacity a little bit this month and hope it returns after school starts next week.

After all, I do have those deadlines.

Here's to a peaceful start to September -- for all of us!

xoxo,

Jaclyn

** Upcoming appearances! **

I'm lining up some in-person and virtual appearances for the fall. First up, I'll be a guest in author and writing coach Paulette Perhach's Harnessing ADHD's Wild Horsepower, a twelve-week course for writers with ADHD. I'll be talking about how to actually finish a book-length project -- a subject near and dear to my heart! I plan to address work habits, goal setting, and time budgeting (which I also discuss in my Write Life newsletter this week).

For writer types in Maryland, I'll be at the Maryland Writer's Association's annual conference on Sunday, October 20 to talk about how to prepare for bookstore author events.
