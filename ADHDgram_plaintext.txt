Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

Well, I missed the August newsletter. I tend to miss one every year, but usually it happens in the winter. Since it hadn't happened yet I'd started to think 2022 was going to be my year. Alas, it was not meant to be.

Maybe this is the universe trying to help me make peace with imperfection?

Anyway, after an intense summer and a lot of behind-the-scenes work stuff, I've returned to a more regular post schedule on Instagram and The ADHD Homestead (links at the bottom of this email). So far we've talked about accepting help, holding boundaries, finding our people, and remembering to use coupons at the store. It feels good to be back.

Hearing from readers about your lives has buoyed my motivation as I work on my next book. It will be a departure from Order from Chaos -- much less prescriptive self-help, much more story -- and I hope it will help many of us feel seen. Looking forward to sharing more about that in the future!

Also in the future, and hopefully sooner than later, will be a minor overhaul of the ADHD Homestead homepage. We'll continue to talk about it along the way on the Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/ADHDhomestead/posts?filters%5Btag%5D=ADHD%20homestead%20redesign).

Please let me know in the replies here if you can: what are you most often looking for on the blog? What have you wished you could find? Have you wished posts could be displayed in logical groupings, and if so how would you organize them? All suggestions and feedback welcome!

We've also started to discuss some topics related to my next book on the Patreon. In case you missed it, here's some food for thought: do you feel ADHD has affected your ability or willingness to maintain boundaries or stick up for yourself in relationships? Do you tend to assume things are your fault, or you should be the one to change? Hit reply and let me know.

I think it's easy for us to condition ourselves to assume we're the problem. We know we *can* be the problem. And yet this doesn't mean we're always the problem, or we can never ask others to accommodate us. This kind of discernment is challenging for a lot of people and I suspect even more so if you have ADHD. Your thoughts on this welcome!

Looking forward to whatever fall brings, and wishing all of you a peaceful month ahead.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
