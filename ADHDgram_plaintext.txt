Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

Sometimes I feel like the ADHD internet pressures us to conform to a common ADHD "type." I see calls to live authentically and fully accept and celebrate our unique selves, but this comes with a specific picture of what that self should look like. It's packaged as inclusivity and acceptance, yet it often puts me in an all-to-familiar place: on the fringe.

The thing is, anyone can have ADHD, and we're as diverse a bunch of individuals as any other group.

I had a really long letter written for today, one that discussed the Enneagram and a recent epiphany I had while listening to an episode of Glennon Doyle's podcast We Can Do Hard Things. It ended up feeling like a little much, at least for now.

Rather than lose my message in a long rumination, I'll say it simply: ADHD, and life in general, can and does look different for all of us. If your life doesn't look like some ADHD advocate on social media thinks it should, even if you would never even want your life to look that way, there is still room for you in the clubhouse.

As a kid, I felt misunderstood when my behaviors and actions ran counter to my values and intentions. An outside observer could easily assume I felt a certain way based on my behavior, but this assessment didn't describe the "real" me at all. Other people told me what I felt and what I wanted, I tried to tell them I felt and wanted something different, and they told me I was wrong. I was lying to them or to myself or both.

Back then I never could've imagined the level of advocacy and community we have now. In many ways this is great. We also now have a responsibility to each other not to perpetuate the dynamic I described above.

We all derive meaning from life in different ways. The same actions can have different motivations. Different people have different fears and desires. All can come from a valid and authentic place, and none have more inherent value than the others.

Even if we have ADHD.

ADHD gives us some things in common, but we ought to be careful when assuming how many. I exercise care in telling my story because it is just that: my story. I don't often talk about what ADHD "is" or "means" because our ADHD experiences vary so broadly. Many people have found kinship and connection in my words without me telling them how their story should read.

If you enjoy podcasts, I highly recommend listening to the Enneagram episode of We Can Do Hard Things (https://pca.st/s5jz3q7n) through an ADHD lens. I found it super validating, and it also helped me see the other side. I may not fit into everyone's "ideal" ADHD mold, but some will find a home in that mold and that is a good thing. There's room for all of us, and we all have a meaningful story to tell.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
