Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

If you've read my work for any length of time, you may know I dislike New Year's resolutions. Although maybe this year I should make an exception. In 2022, I'd like to avoid free trial periods.

I know plenty of people who love a free trial. I've heard if you juggle them right, you can avoid paying for things like wholesale club memberships and premium television services.

Free trials fail to excite me anymore, unless I plan to pay for the service anyway. I've come to view the free trial as an ADHD trap. No one needs more of those.

This Thanksgiving, we rented a cabin through Airbnb instead of staying with family. It was delightful. Our cabin even had a funky old piano!

It was here I finally caved to my kid's requests to download a popular piano instruction app. It offered a seven-day trial, which I figured would serve us for the duration of our trip. After that I could opt in or out based on his actual practice time.

You know where this is going, right? I made a time commitment on an off-the-grid vacation. I miscalculated when the seventh day would fall by one day. Or maybe the whole thing slipped my mind? I don't know. I thought I had it under control, despite having no reason to believe this would be the case.

So I got a surprise email from the App Store with a receipt for my one-year subscription to this piano app.

Before anyone hits reply to tell me, I know I could probably contact Apple and plead my case. I'm good at this sort of persuasive writing. As a twenty-something I never paid a parking ticket, even though on many occasions I should have.

But that felt like another thing to do and think about at a time when I could not handle the idea of doing or thinking about even one more thing. This, along with the app subscription itself, falls under the heading of The ADHD Tax.

My kid abandoned the piano almost immediately but I decided to pick it up again. Ironically, this app may have made piano practice more ADHD-friendly for me. Users must practice and progress through a training path to unlock new songs. The structure of it pushes back against my tendency to skip straight to the fun stuff at the back of the lesson book. Its cheesy backing music makes the rote exercises slightly less tedious. Knowing the tedious exercises will lead directly to a song I want to learn makes the remaining tedium more palatable.

Plus, I've paid for a year of AI piano lessons. Circumstances being what they are, I suppose I should make a New Year's resolution to continue my piano practice.

Who knows, maybe the app I didn't mean to buy will help support me in this goal.

If you're making resolutions today, try to maintain a bit of humor and flexibility. The ADHD lifestyle requires it.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
