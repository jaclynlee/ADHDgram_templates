In this issue:
* Keep it simple
* Do what works
* Books n stuff
========================================================

It's the week after Thanksgiving break, and I have the big ADHD conference coming up in a few days. Bonus: Sunday is my birthday.

Let's keep this letter simple, shall we?

And maybe use that as a theme going into the home stretch of 2023.

ADHD sometimes nudges us toward everything shiny. Everything that sounds good. Everything we think we should do, should be able to handle, because it's what "normal people" do.

Setting aside my skepticism about the existence of "normal people," I want us to stop holding ourselves to that standard.

There will always been people in our lives who are a little (or a lot) extra. Especially around the winter holidays. It's easy for us to feel like we should be extra, too. Sometimes this comes from within, and sometimes it comes from others making overt comparisons right to our faces.

You know what though? We can love that for them, then just do our own thing. What works for us. It's fine.

Even though it often feels like it will be Not Fine.

Even if some people will actually be Not Fine, because they're a little extra. It's an opportunity to practice setting healthy boundaries.

This can feel daunting, but it's worth it. On my deathbed I won't be thinking, "I wish I'd spent more time trying to do what other people wanted." If you're reading this I don't think you will, either.

My son once gave me a note with a pensive-looking figure drawn at the top and a caption that said, "Remember I have ADHD."

I think about that note all the time. He gave it to me after he thought I'd expected something from him he couldn't provide.

It's a reminder we could all use.

Remember you have ADHD.

Proceed accordingly.

You don't need to be extra, unless it brings you joy.

xoxo,

Jaclyn

** Remember to rest **

From a post on my Instagram [https://www.instagram.com/p/CmWsAZ7OEOX/]:

I know some people will fault me
for sending out New Year's cards.
Before you assume it's *all*
about performative political correctness,
I invite you to consider the possibility
I simply could not manage
the hard December 25 deadline
even if I wanted to.
