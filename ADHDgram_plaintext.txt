Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

I hope this letter finds you transitioning smoothly from holiday mode into the new year. Transitions are tough for most ADHDers. We have a lot of inertia: we struggle to get into gear on many things but once we get started, we can have just as much trouble stopping.

Many folks had a stressful holiday season this year. I talked about kin-keeping, boundaries, and expectations in this month's Audioblog episodes (https://www.patreon.com/ADHDhomestead?filters[tag]=audioblogs) and blog post (https://adhdhomestead.net/2020-christmas-adhd/). Our brains are tired!

At the same time, transitioning into the next phase can be as challenging as staying in this one. Most of us need extra time and space to change gears.

Day to day, I've been trying to recognize my need for that extra transition time. Things have felt very hectic and distracting for the past couple weeks. I've spent a lot of time and energy planning meals, arranging Zooms, and hitting refresh on USPS tracking information. When I have had an hour or two to catch up on my regular work, my brain hasn't always been ready to use it properly. I can't just sit down at my desk and turn off that hectic feeling.

So I take a walk. It's easy to tell myself I ''only''  have so much time in my day and I ''don't have time'' for a meandering walk around the neighborhood. But the walk helps me calm down. It helps me change gears. Without the walk, I might not take advantage of those little pockets of productive time at all.

Taking time for transitions — be it with a walk, a short guided meditation, or five minutes of stretching in a quiet room — helps the dust settle in our brains. It readies us for what's next, be that work we need to do or simply taking time to relax. (Yes, transitioning into relaxation time is a thing as well!)

While I fully support setting goals and looking forward to the year ahead if that's your thing, I hope you'll take a few minutes to rest, reflect, and prepare your heart and mind for the transition.

Here's to a hopeful, peaceful 2021.

xoxo,

Jaclyn

** Introducing printables in the merch shop! **

I've wanted to offer printables for a long time, and I finally just did it! Sometimes I make a tool for myself that I can easily adapt into a template to help others. I did this with a chore schedule a few months ago, which I shared with my patrons (https://www.patreon.com/posts/i-refuse-to-use-42120194).

Last week a reader wrote to ask me about the ''trouble tickets'' I discuss in Order from Chaos. I'd adapted my system from my days working IT support, but could I recommend something simple enough to use with younger kids?

I couldn't, but I could make one easily enough.

And so my printable shop was born. Anyone can now download my chore schedule template or friendly request form for just $0.99 (https://adhdhomestead.net/shop/).

Because I appreciate my ADHDgrammers, you can download either one for free with coupon code ADHDGRAMPRINT21.

Please let me know what you think! And clearly, I'm always open to requests ;)
