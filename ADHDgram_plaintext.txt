Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

It's been a month. Many friends seem to have words to speak about what we, as a society, have been through this month. I do not. Not yet, anyway. I often receive hard things stoically, and prefer to process my feelings about them alone. This doesn't always work, I know. And I've tried and tried and tried again to write this letter as something more relevant and compelling, because it felt necessary to do so.

None of it came together right. I set the whole messy pile of words aside.

For now, I'll tell you all something simple. Silly, almost, and yet still important. Last week I ran into someone I haven't seen in years, a parent of one of my son's preschool friends. We chatted briefly and, to my relief, not too awkwardly. I told her about a strategy we've been using to manage screen time and chores this summer (You can see it in action here: https://www.instagram.com/p/CfWo54tub0D/). She told me it sounded brilliant.

"Well," I replied, "I have no faith this will be a permanent solution. But it's working now, and so I'm going to milk it for all it's worth until I'm forced to figure something else out."

My kid may have summer vacation now, but we adults need help too. Almost everyone I've talked to lately has told me they feel distracted. Can't think straight. And of course they can't. Anyone paying attention to U.S. news this month has probably felt overwhelmed at more than one point. It's been...a lot.

So maybe let's just do what we can. I feel like there's sometimes an anxiety, and expectation of failure, for people with ADHD. This week I've gone to the bouldering gym every day, but I'm already wondering how long it will take me to stop going at all. I cleaned off our dining room table, which was a mess, but my satisfaction is tinged with resignation that the mess will return.

Let's not do that right now. If something is working, if we're on a good streak, let's try to enjoy it. Appreciate it fully. Because nothing is permanent, and that's okay. We don't need to mourn the end of something when it's only just begun. We can benefit from a good habit even if we know it won't last forever.

And we can give ourselves a break if things are hard and chaotic and overwhelming. Because those times don't last forever, either. My dining room table got covered in a huge mess of papers and legos and who knows what else because I worked too much and didn't remind anyone to tidy it. That's over now, and the table is clear. Ready for whatever comes next.

Sometimes it's really hard not to sink into despair, but good or bad, no season lasts forever. And in this current season, we just have to find something that works for now. That's what the world needs from us: the best we can do with whatever works for now.

Whatever that something is, let's hold onto it as long as it lasts.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
