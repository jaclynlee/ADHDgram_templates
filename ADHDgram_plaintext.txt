Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

I've seen comments here and there on social media where people claim their ADHD medication feels less effective than it used to. Many have speculated this is due to "tolerance" and means they should go on a "holiday" or "break" to reset things.

This sounds like a punishing sort of holiday to me, but perhaps some find it helpful? I don't know. It just seems irresponsible for my personal situation, which includes things like driving a car and surfing and caring for a child and several other activities that feel safer and healthier with meds than without.

Anyway. People can make whatever choices feel right for them.

However, I want to take this moment to remind everyone where that enraging sentiment, "We're all a little ADHD sometimes" comes from. Persistent stress and uncertainty can create ADHD-like symptoms in even the most put-together, non-ADHD people among us. Sleep deficits as mild as averaging six hours of sleep per night can mimic ADHD and -- watch out, you can't unhear this one -- drunk driving.

I've felt it, too. Like my ADHD meds aren't helping as much. But here's the thing. If stress and uncertainty nudge the average person in an ADHD direction, imagine what that means for those of us already living in ADHD-land. It's not like we're unaffected. On the contrary, we're going to slip even deeper into the weeds.

That "everyone's a little ADHD sometimes" thing? It happens to us, too. Sometimes life makes ADHD worse.

I'm not a doctor. I've never spoken to most of you one-on-one, let alone met you in person. I don't know your personal situation. But I do know mine, which seems pretty average, and let me tell you, it's ADHD Extra right now. Something could change the whole structure of my day/week at any moment. I'm assuming the conference talk I have next month will be in person and I'm hoping not to get the Quarantine Call from my kid's school but I have precious little control over any of these uncertainties.

I've always said, meds don't make life easy. They level the playing field (for a lot of us, anyway). If the playing field is unmanageable, well -- here we are.

Life won't be like this forever. Really. It will calm down at some point (or at least I have to tell myself they will). Until then, things will slip and we'll make mistakes and maybe we'll wonder if our meds have suddenly stopped working. (If my prior experience holds, they haven't.)

We're going to have to show ourselves and each other a little compassion.

That's all.

xoxo,

Jaclyn

(P.S. If you have kids in school I hope you don't get the Quarantine Call, either. Yeesh.)
