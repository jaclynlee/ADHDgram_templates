========================================================

Hey friends! I hope April is treating you well so far. It’s been kind of a whirlwind for me. My book launch is now less than a week away. Ready or not, She’s Not Home hits bookstores on April 25.

(More book info here: https://www.jaclynpaul.com/shes-not-home-launch-info/)

I feel a lot of pressure not to drop the ball on preparations for this launch. I want to do this work right, both for myself and for those who have invested in or taken a chance on my book.

I also still have ADHD. Always and forever.

The past couple weeks have been really interesting. I’ve noticed myself saying no all the time.

Do I want to put anything out for the neighborhood yard sale this weekend?

Oh absolutely, I need to clean out so badly, but nope, no can do, sorry. Not going to have time to sort through my stuff.

Am I cooking dinner from scratch?

Only if I feel like doing it for fun.

Can I get to the room early to set up tech for that meeting?

No.

I’ve never done this before. Never said no to so many things I technically could do, but don’t want to because I have a major event coming up and I need to focus on that. Because I need time to decompress so I don’t spend the next two months recovering from burnout. Because last time I poured everything into work stuff without reducing other demands, I came out of it not even remembering who my friends were.

Because I can let other people take responsibility and do s***, too.

This isn’t hyperfocus. It’s something far less familiar. It’s...limited focus? I’m leaving white space around my priorities. Not filling every day to bursting.

As a result, I feel far calmer and far more prepared than I normally would going into this final week. Some days have been filled to bursting, but I’ve felt less frazzled because I’ve stepped back and said no to other things. The less-intense days have given me headspace to notice when I’ve dropped the ball on something and pick it back up before it becomes an emergency.

This is a revelation for me. Also, I want to keep it going after this Tuesday. I want to remember I don’t have to do something just because I can, and/or because it seems like a good thing to do. If it distracts from my current priorities, I can say no.

The world will go on.

I am, thank goodness, not that important.

Are any of us?

I offer these thoughts in case you, too, are the perpetual-motion style of ADHD individual. The one who can’t even uncheck the “don’t ask me this again” box when the computer asks you a question. We have to miss out on some things to give our full self to what really matters.

And maybe giving something our all looks a little emptier, a little less chaotic, than we’re used to. It sure does for me.

xoxo,

Jaclyn

** All things She's Not Home **

If you enjoy reading novels, please check out my book She's Not Home! It's a family drama about grief, friendship, and the bonds we make with the people and places we call home. (https://www.jaclynpaul.com/shes-not-home-launch-info/)

I always sneak an ADHD character (or several) into my fiction because I want people to see us represented on the page in all our complexity. Let me know how you feel about the ADHD tidbits you find in the book. (Preorder and other info here: https://linktr.ee/lenageorge)

And just for my Baltimore pals, you are invited to the official in-person launch event on Tuesday! The Ivy Bookshop will host a reading and discussion on their back patio at 6:00 p.m. (Info here: https://www.theivybookshop.com/upcomingevent/33810)
