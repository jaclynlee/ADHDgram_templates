Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

When I'm learning a new skill, I think through its processes quite explicitly. Toe side, I'll say to myself as I execute a turn on my snowboard. Okay, press into that back heel. Two inside, one outside, I'll chant to myself as I tie a taught-line hitch. Paddle paddle paddle! after I've positioned my surfboard to catch a wave. I need my inner (or outer, if no one's listening) coach-voice to remind my body what to do.

Later, I operate on feeling and wordless instinct. Instinct allows me to bend rules I could not have bent at the beginning. I can move faster, respond to the unexpected more nimbly (or at all), and regain my balance after a wobble.

As I wrap up a few months of intense book editing, I'm acutely aware I could not have done this work ten years ago. At least not as well, or as efficiently.

I don't think instincts can be taught. Foundation skills can, but then we're on our own. You have to feel it to know it.

During this season of editing and deadlines I've also paid attention to my ADHD instincts.

Back in the early days, I needed rigid structure and rules. I still do in many cases. However, I've started to attune my ear to those instincts and test my own boundaries.

For example, in the last edition of this email (https://newsletters.jaclynpaul.com/adhdgram_archive/2022/2022-03.html) I talked about letting myself hyperfocus for longer stretches than I normally would. I needed to do this to meet my deadline. However, it also felt kind of exhilarating, to use my mental muscles in this way.

It was also exhausting and unsustainable. I still don't think I've recovered. My mood and focus are off and I've been slow to catch up on the things I let slip.

A few years ago I may not have let those things slip in the first place. I wouldn't have trusted myself to come back. And I need to come back. I need a certain level of structure and balance in my life. The amount of hyperfocus, in-the-zone work I've done over the past few months is neither healthy nor sustainable.

But I decided it was okay to let the ADHD horse out of the barn this time. I had a deadline. I also knew I'd have a lot of space after that deadline to transition out of it slowly.

Self-knowledge allowed me to let go of my usual rules in an intentional, specific way (more on that here: https://www.jaclynpaul.com/4-boundaries-that-helped-me-meet-big-writing-deadlines-this-month/). I accepted the short-term costs and anticipated my needs on the other side.

It's kind of like when I was a kid my family taught me never to be the furthest person out in the ocean. This kept me safe while I got stronger and developed my instincts for our home beach. Now I might be the furthest out, or the only one out, but I know when this is okay and when it's not.

ADHD requires us to develop rules and boundaries and systems for keeping the chaos at bay. This scaffolding also changes over time. We learn, we grow, and we develop instinctual self-knowledge.

But it all takes time. We can't rush it. We can't hack it. Just like any skill, we have to learn to feel our way through it.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
