Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

Starting around Halloween, our household feels like a whirlwind of activity through the end of January. This can feel really stressful. There's so much going on, and it all feels important, and my ADHD self worries incessantly about dropping the ball.

This year I'm heading into our busy season already feeling scattered, behind, and overwhelmed. Whoops!

At times like this I always try to refocus on intentionality and mindfulness. It's easy to get sucked into reactive mode and spend entire days (or weeks) putting out fires and making zero progress on bigger projects. This doesn't work during the holidays. They seem to have a thousand deadlines and moving parts, including expectations from extended family we don't see regularly and can easily forget to check in with. Yeesh! It's totally worth it to take a breath and get our bearings once in a while.

Remembering to do this, however, can be its own challenge.

This month I've kept "mindfulness/meditation" on my list of mini habit/habit heart goals. I've done this before but I daresay this is the first time I've felt deeply successful.

A lot of ADHDers seem to feel we're "bad at meditation." Sometimes we mean we're bad at *focusing*, or at least at directing our focus. This does not make one "bad at meditation." I'm pretty sure the only way to be "bad at" meditation is not to do it at all.

That's where I was for a long time. My issue isn't the meditation itself. I love mindfulness meditation. My struggle is to actually sit my butt down and *do the thing* on a regular basis.

This month I changed tactics. I let go of the expectation that I make time to ~sit down and meditate~ every day. It wasn't working. I wasn't doing it. Instead, I pulled mindfulness into my everyday activities: walking to the gym, cleaning up the kitchen after dinner, sitting down at my desk and wondering where the heck to start.

The results have been kind of amazing. Meditation has become something I can turn to at any time. My buzzing thoughts so easily take me out of my body and keep me from being truly present. I've been shocked to realize just how much time I spend in some level of dissociation. I'm working on this, because those moments of presence and ease are also the spaces where I can listen for my inner voice. I can decide what to do next, or where to direct my focus.

This takes a lot of practice. I don't claim to be anywhere close to "there" yet, but I feel closer. I also feel like I've gotten way more benefit from this integrated mindfulness practice than I ever did from "normal" meditation.

If you've tried a different approach to mindfulness meditation, I'd love to hear about it! And if you're new to the practice, I recommend trying the Headspace app. I actually got this whole idea from a weeklong free trial with them, during which I tried a walking meditation.

However you get through the holidays, whether the busiest ones are behind you or just ahead, I hope you're able to find a few spare moments to breathe. It's hard -- to remember, to sit still for, to do in general -- but I've found even an imperfect effort can make a huge difference.

xoxo,

Jaclyn

** A new ADHD Homestead homepage is on the way! **

The look and feel of the ADHD Homestead homepage has changed relatively little since its birth in 2014. After accumulating over one hundred thousand words of content, we need something new! I'm planning a low key relaunch to kick off the winter. The new site will help readers find what they're looking for a little bit easier. A chronological archive of blog posts is just not cutting it anymore!

You all will be among the first to see it when it's ready. In the meantime, feel free to let me know what you'd like to see! What would you like to find -- easily -- at The ADHD Homestead? I've already received a request for more digital materials in the shop, including the Order from Chaos ebook for folks outside regular distribution regions. That's definitely on the list!
