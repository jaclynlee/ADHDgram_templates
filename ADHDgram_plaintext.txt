Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

I have to confess, the past month or two have felt like a bit of a Bad ADHD Time for me. I feel pretty confident these times happen to all of us.

And it's okay not to love it. It's okay to be frustrated. I don't think any of us have an obligation to embrace our ADHD and celebrate it as a keystone of our identity.

Wallowing in self-loathing is another issue. As much as we may want to throw in the towel and say forget it, this is not the way. We've come too far.

My ADHD has not been my friend lately, but every relationship has its rough patches. We'll get the show back on the road eventually.

In the meantime, mindset can make such a huge difference when I'm floundering.

Last week I cleaned a huge amount of clutter out of our workshop and my husband told me, "I don't know how you motivated yourself to do it." I suspect he wants to believe my ADHD simply isn't as debilitating, but the real truth is I just got mad enough. For better or worse, when I get sick of the status quo, I go into slash-and-burn mode. I also have a surprisingly deep well of physical endurance.

And I crave this exact sort of visible, tangible progress. Change that literally surrounds me. It's what I reach for when I need a morale boost, even if it doesn't top my must-do list.

When we're struggling, I think it's okay not to do the Most Urgent and Productive Thing(TM) at every opportunity. Yes we need to file taxes by the deadline. Some tasks need to happen on a schedule. But we can only force ourselves through so much.

If you're distracted by the tumult in your world or the wold in general or both simultaneously, you may need a morale boost, too. I'm talking one tiny step forward on a stagnating project. Crossing off one silly task that's nonetheless haunted our to-do list for years. Giving ourselves a simple reminder of our ability to move forward. Do things. Tend to our surroundings. Tend to ourselves.

Because we can do the things we want to do, even if we've fallen off the wagon.

Stagnation, overwhelm, failure -- these are not permanent states. When we feel stuck, sometimes we need to ask not what we "should" do next, but what might remind us, however briefly, what it's like to feel steady and capable.

This week, I think I will paint a little table I inherited from my grandmother. In 2007, I started to apply a first coat of paint to it. I don't remember why I stopped, but around one-third of the table has had a very thin coat of different-color paint on it ever since. Fixing this is my reward for making space in the workshop for a relaxing physical project, but also me sending a message to myself. Even if I let a task slip for fourteen(!) years, I have not failed irreparably. I'm still alive, I still love the table, and I can hold my chin high and paint it. Finally.

There are plenty of other things I need to do this week. Obviously this is not urgent. However, completing the task will feel like a gift and an act of healing.

Sometimes those are urgent, too.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
