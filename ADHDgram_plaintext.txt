Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

I've spent a lot of time catching up lately. It's all part of a cycle: I get behind, I get frustrated about getting behind, and then I channel that frustrated energy into a flurry of work to get back on track.

I used to get down on myself for this. True success, in my mind, was never getting behind in the first place. I saw these temporary lapses as proof that no matter what, I always managed to mess things up eventually.

In my book Order from Chaos, I take a different perspective. I accept lapses and failures as both inevitable and normal. Things happen: holiday seasons, times of illness or stress, overcommitment. And they happen to everyone, whether we have ADHD or not.

The key is to build failure into our systems. To expect it. For me, that means organizing my life with systems that aren't just easy to maintain, but easy to put back together. If we feel completely overwhelmed by the idea of restarting an organizational tool after some time away, we'll probably never use it again. I aim to make the coming back feel as easy as possible.

I also try to accept the time this return will take. I didn't get behind in a day, and I probably won't get caught up in a day, either. This is where tiny goals come in. Right now I need to catch up on my personal inboxes, both the basket next to my desk and my personal email. I don't like being behind on these things and I want the problem fixed immediately. However, I don't have time to make that happen — at least not without getting behind on something else, which would defeat the point.

My goal this week is to make a net gain on my personal inboxes every day. In other words, number of things I processed today > number of things I received today. If I receive five emails, I want to clear six out of my inbox. If I bring three pieces of mail inside this afternoon, I want to eliminate four items from the inbasket next to my desk.

No lofty goals.

Sometimes, if I'm struggling extra hard to get started on my inboxes, I'll set a timer for fifteen minutes. Knowing I can leave the task after a finite period of time makes it feel much more approachable. It also gives me a clear measure of success: I said I would work for fifteen minutes, and I did. Otherwise, my brain defaults to thinking empty inbox = success. I know I can't achieve that today, so why even try?

If a system helps you keep up with life most of the time, it's fine. It's working. Nothing is airtight. Just make sure when you do have the inevitable screw-up, your system is built to accommodate that. We all fall off the wagon. All I ask at this point in my life is that the bottom step of the wagon be low enough for me to get a foothold and climb back on before it leaves me in the dust.

xoxo,

Jaclyn

** Order from Chaos audiobook...soon! **

I don't have much concrete news to share yet, but I want my inner circle to know because I often get emails asking about it: the Order from Chaos audiobook is on the way! If you've been wanting to read the book, or recommend it to someone else, but audio is the only realistic option to get through it, don't worry. It's coming.

The pandemic derailed my original plans, but this winter I signed with a publisher to produce the audiobook on an actual deadline — and one that doesn't rely on me! This is truly the best news. It means I can put my full focus on my writing and feel confident the Order from Chaos audiobook will still get to readers as soon as possible.

I appreciate everyone's patience — I know many of you love audio! — and can't wait to share more details as I'm able.

**  Free interview program for ADHD women **

This winter I also joined Lani Lecielle to record an interview for her event Neurodivergent Girls: Recognize Your Strengths, Reduce Overwhelm, and Realize Your Dreams. It's a free event dedicated to answering questions about neurodiverse women and providing support by sharing insightful information from Lani's guest speakers.

Lani says: "The feedback [from past attendees has been] really amazing. Most enjoy the interviews because of how close the topics really are to their heart. This is literally a place for chicks like us, to connect with chicks like us!"
