In this issue:
* Am I really that prepared and organized...?
* New book!
* Thank you
========================================================

I just wrote a post on my personal blog (https://www.jaclynpaul.com/how-to-prepare-for-a-bookstore-author-event/) about how I prepare for author events. People always seem to comment on my preparedness, whether it’s for a conference talk or a small bookstore event.

People also say I keep my calendar "so organized," or am "a really good note taker."

Which is weird, because...ADHD.

I tend to deflect these compliments. Say I’m not, not really. My self-perception is pretty far off from that person who shows up on time and prepared. But that person is often who others see.

As I wrote that blog post I was reminded how much my weaknesses in certain areas can -- sometimes, definitely not always -- pave the way to strengths.

Because I have no expectations of being put-together, prepared, or coherent by nature, I have to figure out how to make it happen through careful preparation.

Because I forget nearly everything, I have to rely on my notes and calendars.

It feels unfair sometimes. I do have to work harder than most people to achieve a "normal" baseline.

But when times get tough, or when I have to give a talk in front of an audience, that extra work can give me an advantage.

I have no illusions about my need to prepare intentionally for an important event. Sometimes it feels like a burden, but I also never wrongly assume, "I’ve got this." When someone compliments me on my author reading or conference talk, I give thanks for all my extra practice building this skill.

Don’t get me wrong -- I don’t consider my ADHD a gift, not at all. I don’t expect you to, either. But I *do* think we can see some bright sides. We’re forced to think about things and build skills in areas other people take for granted. When the day comes they can’t take it for granted, we’ve already gotten a head start.

I’m curious: has managing life with ADHD forced you to gain any skills that set you apart? How do you feel when people compliment you on it? (I still find it kind of awkward!)

xoxo,

Jaclyn

** All things She's Not Home **

If you enjoy reading novels, please check out my book She's Not Home! It's a family drama about grief, friendship, and the bonds we make with the people and places we call home. (https://harborviewpress.com/our-books/shes-not-home/)

I always sneak an ADHD character (or several) into my fiction because I want people to see us represented on the page in all our complexity. Let me know how you feel about the ADHD tidbits you find in the book. (More info here: https://www.jaclynpaul.com/my-books/)
