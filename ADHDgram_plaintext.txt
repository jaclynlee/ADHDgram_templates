* Events! Back-to-school! Catching up!
* Thank you
========================================================

Hey friends! School started here this week. We had a lovely summer but I'm also glad to get back to a more regular routine.

Before I get talking about anything else, I want to share an event announcement. Next week I'll be at the Frenchtown Bookshop in Frenchtown, New Jersey. Come see me if you're in the area! I'll be doing a reading, Q&A, and signing for my book She's Not Home at 6:30 p.m. on Thursday, September 7.

This event kicks off a super busy September for me. As of now I'm excited. We'll see how I feel when I reach the finish line (a speaking engagement on September 30).

I do know one thing: I'll have to catch up on a lot of at-home stuff that first week of October.

This first week of school is good practice. I spent the entire summer break without my normal meds, and our schedules and routines always felt in flux. It was a lot.

When school started on Monday, I had big plans. I finally got my prescription filled (thank goodness) and my kid was out of the house for seven hours a day. What couldn't I do?

This is certainly a better situation, work-wise, than I was in last week. It also does nothing to erase the preceding three months. I have a lot to catch up on.

Fortunately, I've been to this rodeo before. I know this week is going to be all about catch-up and not so much about bold new accomplishments.

If your family is just starting a new school year, I hope you'll go easy on yourself. A backlog isn't built in a day. It doesn't get cleaned up in a day, either.

Happy September, everyone. Here's to doing okay ;)

xoxo,

Jaclyn
