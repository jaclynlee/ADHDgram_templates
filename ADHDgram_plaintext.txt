Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

I woke this morning to the surprising news December is…tomorrow. Perhaps you know the feeling.

In deference to our overloaded brains, I'll try to keep this letter short and to the point. Or perhaps two points.

Point One: For any number of reasons, we may not want to replicate our pre-pandemic holiday activities. That's okay. This year, we turned Thanksgiving into a mini vacation to upstate New York and enjoyed a small gathering with family we rarely see. It was a departure. It felt a little risky -- would people be upset? Will people be upset we're hosting Christmas dinner at our house instead of traveling?

Maybe. I don't know. No one's *said* they're upset, but I've learned many humans do not do this even if they are upset. That can be confusing and stressful.

But also, people are entitled to less of us than we think. I used to envy my neighbors for their ability to have Christmas and Thanksgiving at home.

"I wish I could have at least one of those holidays at home," I'd say. "I'd love to be able to have even one tradition of my own."

Last year, when we *had* to have those holidays at home, it hit me. No one was stopping me. My neighbors had similar family situations to our own, some with family even farther away who came in for the holidays. Rather than envying or even resenting them, I could take a page from their book.

Holidays are a lot for ADHD families. Whether you find it easier to travel or stay home, no one is entitled to decide for you. You don't have to do it the hard way *every* time. And even if someone *does* feel upset or disappointed by your choices, that doesn't automatically mean you made a mistake. We can get mired in our rejection sensitivity, but people are *allowed* to feel disappointed.

So we're going out on a limb and hosting Christmas *on* Christmas this year. I don't know how it will go but I do know I've seized the opportunity to set some deadlines.

Which brings me to Point Two: Inviting people over is a great way to clean your house.

Seriously.

I've done something rash and ill-advised by committing to a minor renovation of our guest quarters before Christmas. I don't recommend this because it's irrational and disregards current supply chain issues. However, the rest of the house could use some work and our holiday hosting will help a.) motivate my family to help clean and b.) justify hiring a one-time cleaning crew when I realize just how rash and ill-advised this renovation project was.

If you can safely invite even a small dinner party over this month, I highly recommend setting a date and using this as a deadline to finish lingering chores around the house. Entertaining helps me maintain a home *I* enjoy living in, and I've sorely missed it during the pandemic.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
