Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

In this week's Audioblog, I talked about the difference between "ADHD is..." and "ADHD manifests for me as..."

I was talking specifically about a big ADHD sticking point: getting places on time. Many ADHDers are habitually late, but ADHD is not showing up late despite your best efforts.

In fact, some ADHDers are almost never late! Some arrive inappropriately early because we're so anxious about the prospect of being late.

ADHD is the underlying cause of both of these issues, even though they look like opposites.

This can be true of many things, and it's one reason I tread carefully when I talk about what ADHD actually is.

These days, a lot of ADHD influencers claim, both implicitly and explicitly, to speak for all of us. They talk about how ADHD manifests for them, but use language that says "ADHD is."

This can hurt the very people they claim to advocate for.

For some, seeing these personal narratives lifted up as the new definition of what it means to live with ADHD will only make them feel more broken. After years of not fitting in, now it feels we cannot even do ADHD properly. We have failed, as one popular ADHD advocate puts it, to "unwrap our gift."

The truth is, having ADHD doesn't give us automatic ADHD expertise. Most of us are only experts in our own lived experience.

It's important to keep this in mind as we travel the internet. A big voice -- lots of followers, a book deal, a blue checkmark next to our profile photo -- doesn't necessarily indicate authority or credibility. Big voices sometimes make mistakes. They presume to know what others' lives are like, and do so incorrectly. They unknowingly self-medicate or seek to heal old wounds by issuing public call-outs.

It's easy to get caught up in the hubbub of social media and think there is only one way to have, or live with, ADHD.

In reality, life with ADHD is as complex and varied as all of us. As all the genetic, environmental, familial, cultural, societal, and other forces that shape who we are.

xoxo,

Jaclyn

** Order from Chaos Virtual Workshop **

The Order from Chaos workshop is coming! I've finally gotten some time to sit down and work on the materials a bit more, and patrons will be participating in a demo session next week. When I have all six sessions ready to go and the patron demos are done, I'll open up registration to the "beta" version of the workshop to my ADHDgram subscribers. Keep an eye on these emails for updates, or join me on Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/ADHDhomestead) to get in on some of the free demos!

In case you missed it, the OFC workshop will be a six-week personal organizing course inspired by my book of the same name. You won't need to read the book to participate and benefit, and the course will include bonus materials to help apply the book's concepts to your life. I'm excited to give this a spin. It will give folks a great opportunity to work through the book without having to sit and read it alone. We'll have a group to offer mutual accountability and support, and I'll be available to help troubleshoot and answer questions along the way.
