Happy Halloween, to those who celebrate!

My Halloween ADHDgram usually talks about holiday stress. Halloween comes with a lot of expectations. I don't know about you, but I lack the cognitive function to meet those expectations.

If this sparks something in your brain, check out my October 2021 ADHDgram [https://newsletters.jaclynpaul.com/adhdgram_archive/2021/2021-10.html], where I think I say it best.

This month, I want to speak in praise of dropping expectations. How often do strict or overwhelming expectations actually help us, anyway? I'd argue far less often than they hurt.

In September I started one of Yoga With Adriene's thirty-day programs [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLui6Eyny-Uzx-IzGg48K4aHGyBwtPh7Sw&si=rKXLCWeLCSNpL9m3]. However, I kept it chill. I explicitly rejected, from Day One, the expectation that I would engage in a daily yoga practice. I hoped to encourage a more regular practice, in part by reducing decision fatigue. On days when I had no other exercise planned, I'd select the next video from the playlist. Simple and low stakes.

I completed the playlist last week. By my estimates, I finished in around thirty-seven days, with most of my missed days falling toward the beginning.

Not too shabby, right? Despite my lack of expectations, I drifted toward a daily practice anyway. I then tried to take a few days off after the thirty days but found it uncomfortable. That twenty-minute practice had worked its way into my routine.

I, like many people with ADHD, have a big sore spot around failure -- especially failure to establish good habits or to do what I set out to do.

To avoid triggering any of this baggage over a thirty-day yoga challenge, I declined to set any criteria for success. This means I also had no criteria for failure. I was just there to experiment and observe.

What do you know, I observed I did a lot better without the scepter of shame and failure hanging over me.

Sometimes we need expectations. Some situations have a clear definition of "success" and "failure." However, I'd encourage you to consider how often this is actually the case.

For me, it's far less often than my brain would like to think.

xoxo,

Jaclyn

** Remember to rest **

From a recent post on my Instagram [https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyl0NyEOUyu/]:

Just because someone else can't rest,
doesn't mean you shouldn't.
Just because someone else has
weak boundaries,
doesn't mean you have to.
Your worth does not come
from matching
another person's
"work ethic."
