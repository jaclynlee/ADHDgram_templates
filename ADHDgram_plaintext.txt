Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

Last weekend I did something unusual for the Pandemic Times: I participated in an in-person event. It felt exciting and a little nerve-wracking — socially, I should clarify, and not for health reasons.

Our local bookstore, The Ivy Bookshop, hosted a sweet little event called Authors in the Gardens. Several local authors staked out picnic tables in the shop's sprawling backyard and spent three hours signing books and talking to readers.

(Here's a photo by the kiddo, who assisted me for most of the event: http://bit.ly/authors-in-the-gardens-ofc-2020-10)

In this time I learned my book is on backorder at one of Ingram's warehouses (wow!), chatted with a couple therapists who wanted to know more about my work and maybe recommend Order from Chaos to their clients, met a woman who'd just received a later-in-life ADHD diagnosis, and reconnected with one of my son's preschool teachers. What a day!

Driving home, I thought about all this and how much I love making individual connections with readers. I love receiving your heartfelt emails and talking to you at events and yes, seeing my print book sales consistently outpace the ebook. This is what sustains me.

I may never get a blue checkmark on my social media profiles or get featured on the news for a viral tweet. I don't get invited to hang with the clique of favorite internet ADHD personalities. I certainly don't measure success by how many people click Like, Share, or Retweet.

And I appreciate that. I try to live at a slower pace.

I'm an author. An in-person author. One who values personal connections, books you can hold in your hands, and a life rooted in something more constant than today's most popular social media platform (don't even get me started on TikTok).

Thank you for making that life possible for me. For those who have read and responded to my words: I appreciate each and every one of you, and I'm honored to have been invited into your life.

xoxo,

Jaclyn

** Do you have an ADHD gardening story? **

This month I kicked off a series of blog posts about breaking down big projects. I plan to use my backyard makeover as an example, and I posted this image on Instagram last week: https://www.instagram.com/p/CG5anUFjbxK/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link

You would not believe the number of people who messaged me about this! Turns out, there are a lot of ADHD gardeners with great stories to tell. Just for fun, I might do a roundup post highlighting some Greatest Hits of ADHD Gardening. If you have a funny story to share, feel free to reply to this email!
