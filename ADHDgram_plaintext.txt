Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

I have a somewhat ambivalent relationship with goals, but I still try to set a few every year. Then I try to check in around the halfway point.

Which, to my surprise, is...now?

Yep, June is around the corner. My life, like just about everyone‚Äôs, has been upended in strange and unexpected ways this spring. And yet as I reflect on what I wanted to do in 2020 (more on that here: https://www.jaclynpaul.com/2020-goal-setting/), I see it‚Äôs not all a wash. I‚Äôm still doing something. Some of it even feels vaguely related to what I set out to do.

These days, that‚Äôs a victory.

I hope you‚Äôre still plugging along. If you‚Äôre struggling to maintain perspective, definitely check out this post about staying grounded when time seems to have no meaning: https://adhdhomestead.net/6-things-to-help-adhd-time-blindness/

Be well,
Jaclyn

2020 Reader Survey: THANK YOU! ü•∞

I owe a huge thank you to everyone who completed my reader survey. On the last day, I sent out an email to let you know I hadn‚Äôt received many responses. The real story: I‚Äôd only received about half as many as I did in 2019.

It‚Äôs a tough time for all of us, I know. I hoped that email would get me a few more surveys. At the end of the day, my survey responses had increased 15 percent over 2019!

Big surprise: we ADHDers benefit from a last-minute reminder email.

Anyway, now I‚Äôm parsing the responses and figuring out what they mean for me going forward. First up: I want to reorganize the front page of The ADHD Homestead. I'm envisioning a few big-picture learning ‚Äútracks‚Äù for people who want to read a bunch of posts on a particular topic. When a blog reaches a certain age, you can miss a lot by reading it chronologically because you‚Äôll never get to the end!

Reader survey data will help me define those topic buckets. I‚Äôm taking the content you told me felt most valuable and making it easier to find.

Anyway, I look forward to giving you more insights into how I use the reader survey. Thank you so much for helping me make it happen!

Something for the social media averse üòâ

I often share a popular post from my Instagram feed at the bottom of this email. I also share links on the ADHD Homestead Facebook page every weekday. While many of you say you love those Facebook shares, I wonder if some of you feel like I do.

I really, really dislike Facebook.

Whenever someone creates an important resource that only exists on Facebook, I feel a little prickly.

I never really announced this, but at the beginning of the year I started collecting everything I share to my Facebook page in a weekly blog post.

If you ever want to take a break from Facebook without losing track of the resources I post there, check out my Internet of ADHD posts every Friday: https://bit.ly/InternetOfADHD. These roundups include not only the links I've shared but any commentary I've offered along with it.

Don't worry, the Facebook page isn't going anywhere -- I just wanted to give you another way to read if you need it üòâ

This post about social struggles really struck a chord

After a two-month muddle of pandemic-related anxiety and adjustments, I finally felt able to get back to some of my regularly scheduled programming this month. This post I wrote about social struggles I've had as a woman with ADHD garnered a lot of comments and shares on social media: https://adhdhomestead.net/social-questions-woman-adhd/.

Knowing we aren't alone in this feels like a mixed blessing. While we don't like that others have felt the same pain, it nonetheless gives us sorely needed kinship and validation.
