Hellooooo friends!

It's been a minute. A few months ago I reconnected with an old friend and it has been such a gift. We didn't dwell on our time apart, just picked up where we left off.

I've been told this is an ADHD thing. After all, what is time? For today I'm going to choose to believe this -- let's pick up where we left off.

Some personal-life things in December threw me for a loop, and then I got covid right before Christmas. This totally derailed my plan to relax, let go of 2022, and spend lots of quality time with friends and family over the holiday break.

Oh well. We're here now, right?

I'm looking forward to an overwhelming but very exciting spring. My debut novel, She's Not Home, comes out on April 25! I'm sure people will love reading this heartfelt family story for book club. (I'll leave it up to you whether you actually discuss the book at book club -- we sometimes get wrapped up discussing the snacks.)

I used a pen name to keep my ADHD-focused work separate from my fiction, but I always sneak ADHD characters into my stories. In many ways, those stories happen the way they do because of ADHD. Having just read a romance novel with a closet ADHD main character (https://www.jaclynpaul.com/book-review-fly-with-me-by-andie-burke-romance/), I know how meaningful it is to see our people on the page!

That is to say, if you're a fiction lover, I encourage you to check out She's Not Home (preorder link here: https://www.jaclynpaul.com/shes-not-home-launch-info/#preorder). I'd love to hear what you think after you read it!

(And don't worry, I'm working on my next non-fiction book, too.)

For those of you close to me in Baltimore, I'd love to have you as a guest at the book launch! I'll be doing a reading and a conversation with another local author at The Ivy Bookshop in Baltimore at 6:00 p.m. on April 25. (Fancy event flyer: https://www.jaclynpaul.com/jaclynpaul_com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/425-Ivy-Lena-George-with-Shawn-Nocher.png)

Read on below for some ADHD Homestead -specific updates! I hope you've all been well over these past few months.

xoxo,

Jaclyn

** Introducing a new look for The ADHD Homestead, and a special deal on books! **

Have you visited the ADHD Homestead website recently? Let me know how you like it! It's still a work in progress, but I updated the site to be more mobile-friendly and conducive to rabbit-hole-style reading. For obvious reasons.

Check out the new site here: https://adhdhomestead.net/

I've also experimented with a merch shop (https://adhdhomestead.net/shop/). Right now there are limited number of personalized, signed copies of Order from Chaos (https://adhdhomestead.net/shop/personalized-signed-copy-order-from-chaos-the-everyday-grind-of-staying-organized-with-adult-adhd/). These make great gifts, and usually you have to find me at a live event to get one! As an ADHDgram subscriber, you can get $5.00 off using coupon code SIGN23 at checkout between now and the She's Not Home launch on April 25.
