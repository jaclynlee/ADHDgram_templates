Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

Our little ADHD household is in a strange season. With summer came a transition from Pandemic Mode into Let's-Do-What-We-Can-While-We-Can Mode. On one hand, I know I need to stretch a little more than I normally would. We don't know what the fall holds for us. If we can safely enjoy time with family and friends we've missed over the past year and a half, we should.

At the same time, I'm burned out. A lot of people seem to have accomplished at least one "pandemic project" since winter 2020. I finished no normal projects, let alone extra ones. In fact, I completely lost touch with my brain's capacity to do any kind of deep work. I also let a lot of stuff slip around the house.

Now I can get a little relief, with school out for the summer and my kiddo able to do a few outside-the-home activities. I no longer have to keep two people's schedules, work, and deadlines in my head concurrently. This would be a great time to catch up.

Except with everyone fully vaccinated, we're now expected to make an appearance at social gatherings we wouldn't have considered last year. This is lovely and restorative. It's also exhausting. Summer holidays and visits put me behind on stuff at home in normal years. I began this summer more behind than ever.

I need another hour in the day, another day in the week. I want to pause time just long enough to clean up my pandemic messes, then hit resume and enjoy life with a clear head.

Given the impossibility of that request, I'm trying to do the next-best thing: acknowledge my frustration and burnout and find productive ways of addressing it in the real world. These feelings can multiply if I feel like my family isn't helping as much as they should. The first step to getting my head in the right place is often a healthy conversation about our respective contributions to the household.

Assuming many of you may have found yourselves in a similar boat, I wrote a blog post about it here: https://adhdhomestead.net/care-about-messy-house/.

Communication has been a big focus for me lately, on the blog and my Audioblogs podcast. It's so important, and yet really challenging with ADHD in the mix. I hope you can apply some of my words to get (and give) the support you need through this season's many transitions.

xoxo,

Jaclyn

** Order from Chaos registration is now open! **

Ready for the real reason this newsletter is late? I knew I was opening Order from Chaos workshop registrations today and wanted to save you a reminder email!

I've had *tons of fun* in our demo workshops this summer and can't wait to hang with more of you in the fall. You can join the workshop as a companion to or replacement for reading the book -- this is basically it in conversational form, with a bunch of new friends.

The Order from Chaos workshop is a space to get to know ourselves, figure out why our past attempts to get organized have failed, and craft our own methods for organizing our lives -- systems that mold to fit *us*, not the other way around.

We'll share our own real-life experiences, answer questions, and do some Zoom show-and-tell to celebrate organizing and decluttering successes. If you know, you know: sometimes those small wins mean everything to us. It's lovely to be part of a group who gets it.

I'm hosting two sessions this fall:
* Thursday evenings at 7:30 p.m. Eastern, September 2 - October 14: www.eventbrite.com/e/159513291549/?discount=ADHDgram-DCJQVMEB
* Saturday mornings at 9:30 a.m. Eastern, September 11 - October 30: www.eventbrite.com/e/159519127003/?discount=ADHDgram-DCJQVMEB

These links will automatically apply a 10% discount at checkout. If you answered my interest survey last fall, look for a special email with an additional discount!

** A little help? **

Y'all have really come through with reviews of Order from Chaos on Goodreads and Amazon. These reviews help new readers discover the book -- and my reader emails tell me they appreciate the discovery! If you've checked out the Order from Chaos audiobook, please take a moment to leave a review on Audible: https://www.audible.com/pd/Order-from-Chaos-Audiobook/1666126446
