Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

This is the second time Iâ€™ve completely rewritten this letter.

Hyperfocus is the real deal, especially at times like this. It feels strange and off-key to talk about anything _other_ than COVID-19 because so many of us have latched onto it and can think of nothing else.

That said, our family is trying to go about life, work, and school as normally as possible within the confines of our home. My husband has a full-time job heâ€™s expected to do from home indefinitely. I have work to do and obligations to fulfill. Our kiddo â€” well, heâ€™s along for the ride. He has a packet from school, plus whatever other projects he finds for himself.

Some ADHDers work well in a crisis. Others fall apart. For some of us, it really depends on the crisis. I tend to pride myself on crisis management, but managing one that upends my precious daily routines and obliterates my usual alone time? I donâ€™t know. Weâ€™ll see.

If youâ€™re struggling extra hard right now, youâ€™re not alone. Iâ€™m trying to figure out how to help all of us feel less alone. Last week I scrapped my planned blog topic and just talked about how our household has managed so far (https://adhdhomestead.net/greetings-camp-covid-19/). I kicked off this week with a live check-in on my Patreon feed (https://www.patreon.com/ADHDhomestead) and a promise to work on more audio and video content. Iâ€™m not sure what the next few months will look like, but I know I wonâ€™t add to the deluge of blog posts with optimistic tips on how to deal with it gracefully.

Talk about our real lives right now feels important. I want to hear how everyone else is getting along.

So â€” how are you getting along? I hope youâ€™re finding your way, slowly but surely. Weâ€™re doing our best over here.

xoxo,
Jaclyn

More audio content on the way!

In a recent livestream (https://www.patreon.com/posts/live-stream-at-34794615), I talked about why my original plan for audio content no longer feels quite right. Then the coronavirus put us all in pandemic mode and changed the landscape yet again.

Itâ€™s a lot of work, but I want to start recording audioblogs â€” maybe even starting this week. Audio versions of blog posts (and eventually _Order from Chaos_ and future books) are a top priority, but Iâ€™d also love to know what else you want to see. Please reply to this email to let me know!

Also, like I said, itâ€™s a lot of work. At least some of the final content will be patrons-only, especially given the effect this pandemic seems to be having on book sales. I doubt bookstores are placing many orders at all these days, especially in our state. All non-essential business have been ordered to close. I encourage you to support this work by becoming a patron of _The ADHD Homestead_ (https://www.patreon.com/ADHDhomestead) â€” something Iâ€™ve made easy by offering tiers as low as $1 per month.

Tip of the Month

I said no tips but itâ€™s been a while since I ran this regular column in the newsletter. That said, Iâ€™ll make it brief: Lower your expectations.

Some parents have taken the school closures to mean they must now homeschool their kids while working full-time from home. I have no such expectation, of myself or anyone else. Weâ€™re doing the best we can.

None of us have experienced anything like this before, and itâ€™s totally unreasonable to expect yourself to adapt instantaneously. Give it time. Give yourself some slack. Let your kid play some extra video games. When in doubt, lower your expectations.
