Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

I won't sugarcoat things. The back-to-school transition has been rough for our family.

No, I'm not complaining about virtual school. Virtual school is going pretty much fine. However, the struggle to transition between summer and fall routines is real.

I say this because I suspect you know what I mean. Changing gears can be extremely difficult for ADHDers of any age. As adults, we often have to hold it together while trying to teach our kids gear-changing skills we may or may not possess ourselves.

One thing has saved my sanity lately: a rededication to single-tasking.

We have too much going on. Our brains aren't made to multi-task. We ADHDers sometimes lay claim to multi-tasking superpowers. We're fooling ourselves. If you're a human with a brain, you can't multi-task, only switch between tasks quickly.

Each of these switches takes a toll on our productivity.

Right before school started, I noticed myself getting into a spiral of bad feelings about my work and progress. Fortunately, I made some quick changes, which you can read about in my September 16 blog post. I have no idea how I would've weathered back to school otherwise.

We're all in a time of transition, whether it's between seasons or cities or daily routines or all of the above and more. When you can grab onto a bit of time for yourself, use it wisely -- and use it for one thing. Something you choose. (Read more about time and intentionality here: https://adhdhomestead.net/busy-but-not-productive-5-productivity-killers-and-how-to-fix-them/)

Take care,

Jaclyn

** Seeking a designer to help me rework the ADHDhs site/visual brand **

This fall, I want to begin a big redesign of the ADHD Homestead website. I talk about all the reasons in a recent Monday video on Patreon, but long story short: I have a lot of content and it's not well-organized.

I've also been working with the same home-brewed site since I founded the blog in 2014. It's time for a change. I need a more curated catalog of content and a visual brand that reflects why people gravitate to my work.

Anyway, I'm currently seeking a designer to help me with the branding and graphic design piece of this project. If you have any referrals to shoot my way, please hit reply and let me know!

** Order from Chaos online course survey still open **

Due to distractions from aforementioned transitions, I haven't done a whole lot of work on my Order from Chaos online course this month! I've left the interest survey open for anyone who still wants to participate. Your opinions and feedback will help me plan the course and put your name on a list to join early phases for free or at a drastically reduced cost.

As a reminder, the course would be a relatively small book club/workshop to help us apply the concepts in the book to organizational challenges in our real lives.
