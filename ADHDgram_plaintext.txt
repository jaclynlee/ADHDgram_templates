In this issue:
* I'm back! Plus five very random thoughts
========================================================

I'm still here! I received a reader email last week with the subject line, "I hope you're still writing," so I figured I'd better clear that up. This newsletter has been offline for a minute. The reasons are very boring and very ADHD, but I'm still here.

I'm also doubling down on email as I take an intentional step back from social media.

In other words: expect me to stay here.

When I first started writing about ADHD in 2014, I don't recall influencers being a big thing. There also weren't terribly many of us on the internet writing about life with ADHD. I have trouble imagining that now. The space feels flooded with self-proclaimed ADHD coaches and experts fighting for our attention, our money, and control of the ADHD narrative. Like with much of social media, people seek out what validates their point of view. They mute or shoot down what doesn't. Credentialed experts and established facts often fail to resonate.

This feels...not great for us. Even if I wanted to play today's social media game, I stopped personal use of it years ago. I feel conflicted about driving more eyes and brains to something I consider actively harmful.

I'll probably still put announcements and occasional updates on there. However, I don't want to include social media as part of my strategy to connect with you, my readers, on a regular basis. At least for now.

I guess that puts the pressure on for this newsletter! We'll see where the adventure leads.

For now I'll close out with five very random thoughts on my mind this week:

   * My husband recently accused our son of putting in "minimal effort" on a science fair project. The kid was one of three students in his class nominated to participate in a larger science fair at a local university. He left the permission slip on the table for his father with a post-it note that read, "minimal effort" (quotation marks his). This was a great burn, but it also got me thinking about ADHD and if not perfectionism, EXTRAism. A lot of us struggle to apply appropriate effort. Sometimes that means we go overboard--or expect our kids to go overboard. This very tendency is what led to me blowing up an empty wine bottle in front of my tenth grade chemistry class.

   * I've been doing a lot of essay writing lately. I think it has to do with the chaos in the world at the moment. (I live in Maryland, so these federal cuts are very real. I talk to people every day who are directly impacted.) I want to do work that gets out into the world more immediately than a book. That said, I'm also lured by the idea of straightforward work. I'm seriously considering trying to pick up a front desk shift at my gym.

   * Speaking of extraism, I registered for a twelve-hour climbing competition because my friends said I should. I've never truly tested the ceiling for my ability to overdo it, perhaps because that ceiling is foolishly high. I can't wait to report the results of this experiment. I may also eat an entire Costco rotisserie chicken at this event, again because my friends said I should. Yes I am forty years old and still behaving this way.

   * Everyone is fixating on national politics. I'm fixating on places I have individual power to make change. About a month ago I latched onto the idea that there is a sidewalk buried under a huge hill on the way to the gym. The Department of Transportation claims there is not. I have evidence to suggest otherwise, and have resolved to conduct my own independent investigation. If there's a sidewalk under there...well, an ADHD person's dedication to a hare-brained mission unrelated to their actual adult responsibilities can truly be a sight to behold.

   * This is not to say I've tuned out national politics. I haven't. I just need to counterbalance the information firehose with a situation where I feel I have some control. Local issues are where that happens.

Feel free to reply with a random thought or two of your own! It's been a minute but I'm so glad to be back in touch.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
