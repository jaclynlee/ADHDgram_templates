Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

Halloween is a few days away, and thanks to some good luck my stress about it has hit a ten-year low.

You'd think ADHDers would enjoy Halloween. I'm sure some of us do! Halloween gives us permission to act like kids again, to indulge in games and dress-ups and all our favorite candies. It can also stress us out.

I rarely dress up, but I admit I do love Halloween night. People drive to our neighborhood from all over to trick-or-treat. Once the first kids show up I spend the entire evening on our porch with my neighbors, a seasonally-appropriate drink, and a huge bowl of candy.

The lead-up is where I go full Halloween Grinch.

Participation on our block requires:

* Decorating the porch/yard
* Acquiring a large supply of candy
* Planning an easy, porch-friendly dinner (crock pot chili is great for this btw)
* Asking my kid for ideas early enough to make or buy a costume he'll like
* If I ask early enough, actually using that time to make or buy the costume we agreed on
* Staying in the loop so we're in the big group picture of the kids in their costumes every year
* Then, staying in the loop and catching opportunities to walk with groups of friends for trick-or-treating

Obviously I don't *have* to do any of this. However, I have a kid at prime trick-or-treating age. I want him to have a costume, be in the group photo literally all the other kids (his friends) are in, and walk around with his pals instead of alone with his parents. This Halloween, I'm keenly aware he's now lived through two years of a pandemic. If he feels emotionally invested in setting up a huge fake spiderweb on our porch, damn it, that is one thing I can give him.

Can't I?

I mean, mostly I can. I do. But we ADHD parents (and/or residents of Halloween-loving neighborhoods) deserve credit for how many moving parts this stuff has.

Last month -- that would be September, for those keeping score at home -- I spotted bags of candy at the wholesale club and greedily piled several into my cart. Look at me! Buying my Halloween stash before October 30!

In a stroke of luck, my kid wanted a Halloween costume we could borrow as a hand-me-down from a neighbor.

It was truly lucky, too, because in addition to Halloween this month I've juggled:

* Prepping and giving a conference talk
* Shipping birthday gifts to out-of-state family
* Figuring out what the hell we're doing for Thanksgiving and Christmas this year
* Helping with our neighborhood's annual Fall Festival
* Hiring contractors to install a new HVAC system in our home (which is also our office)
* My normal work that is not these things

Making the flow of life, the changing of the seasons, a warm and positive experience for the humans around us can strain the ADHD brain.

And that's okay. I've lived a long time this way and usually know how to manage. But this is the kind of stuff people often call "invisible labor." That, friends, does not sit right with me.

Not the labor part. The invisible part. This is work for us. Let's make it visible so we can give ourselves proper credit (and ask for proper support).

As we launch into the holiday marathon, don't forget to give yourself a treat, too.

xoxo,

Jaclyn
