Dear friends,

"People need to know about the amazing things you're doing," brand strategist Madhi Woodard reminded his Instagram followers in a recent post (link: https://www.instagram.com/p/CH-nQEPg_ma/). "Don't get so caught up being modest that you forget to keep marketing."

This got me thinking about my book Order from Chaos (link: https://adhdhomestead.net/orderfromchaos/). People take time out of their lives to send me grateful emails about it, to post five-star ratings on Goodreads and Amazon, and I imagine also to recommend it to friends because heaven knows I'm not the best marketer.

In fact, my reader survey consistently shows half of my own followers don't even know I have a published book.

After reading Mahdi's post I told a friend about my hesitation to put "bestselling" in front of my book's title in my bio. Because who am I, right?

My friend pressed me on that, asking what it would mean about me if I did put the word "bestselling" in my bio.

I thought for a minute and replied, "That I'm a person who thinks their achievements are worth mentioning."

Which is so not me.

I suspect a lot of ADHDers -- especially those of us labeled "gifted" early in life -- can relate. We see it all: the struggles, the shortcomings, all the ways we could do better. And we hear it, too, when others tell us we aren't living up to our potential.

Even when we do accomplish something objectively great, we can have a hard time patting ourselves on the back. We feel uncomfortable shining a spotlight on our work. I know I do.

And that's unfair. We deserve as much credit as anyone else -- sometimes even more.

2020 has been a challenging year for most of us. We've all had to adjust our expectations. However, I hope you'll find some time this month to reflect on what you've accomplished and give yourself credit where it's due.

You are entitled to your accomplishments. Enjoy and appreciate them. You don't need permission from anyone.

xoxo,

Jaclyn

** Help me celebrate my birthday and support other women creating great ADHD content! **

For every 20 patrons on my Patreon, I support a fellow creator making content for women with ADHD. The ADHD Homestead is already a patron of Rene Brooks (aka Black Girl, Lost Keys) and we are SO CLOSE to adding someone new to the list!

If four more people join for just $1 per month, I'll hit my next milestone and The ADHD Homestead will become a patron of The ADHD Good Life!

If you aren't familiar with Sandra's work through The ADHD Good Life, check out her Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/theadhdgoodlife/), Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/TheADHDgoodlife), or podcast (https://adhdgoodlifepodcast.buzzsprout.com/). Every time I listen to her podcast or Instagram stories, it feels like sharing conversation with a friend.

As if that wasn't enough, I'm also giving away a free gift to my patrons for my birthday! Anyone at the $4 (latte) level and above by 9:00 p.m. EST on December 3 will get a surprise sticker in their mailbox!

Patreon is super easy, even if you haven't done it before. It's a great way to give back to creators who offer the bulk of their online work for free. My patrons also get exclusive updates and a podcast I don't share with anyone else! Click here to get started: https://www.patreon.com/ADHDhomestead
