Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

Since the last ADHDgram I've split my time between Maryland and New Jersey -- two states with pretty high COVID vaccination rates. Life here is drifting toward something resembling normal.

In some ways I welcome the change, and not just because I've finally been able to hug my parents after more than a year of separation. My ADHD has definitely felt worse during the pandemic. I'm hoping the gradual decline of baseline stress and distractions will allow my brain to heal and rebalance.

But with "normalcy" comes a raft of other baggage my brain probably functioned better without. I'm back to juggling family visits, comparing summer camp schedules, packing and unpacking the car, choosing potluck dishes, and wondering how much of my July will be consumed by federal jury duty.

Mostly good things. Signs of a full life. My introvert soul has embraced the return of easy, unstructured time with people I love. I've taken heart watching my eight-year-old make friends at the beach and playground, seeming more socially adept than when lockdowns began in March 2020.

It will be a balance: between too much and too little, making up for lost time and overstimulating my tired brain.

I read an article recently warning that it may take time to readjust. My time-blind ADHD self sometimes feels ahead of the curve. Time feels disconnected, today an accurate representation of forever. But I also feel the deep cognitive fatigue of these past eighteen months, and I crave a bit of rest. At the same time, I feel a need to seize the summer. We don't know what fall and winter will bring.

Flexibility is key. It's also not a word people use to describe me. But I'm doing my best to let go, stay flexible, and do what I can.

How are you adapting (or not)? How are you emerging different than before? Feel free to hit reply and share!

xoxo,

Jaclyn

** Save the date! Order from Chaos virtual workshop coming this fall **

You've all heard me talk about Order from Chaos, but maybe you've struggled to get through the book and apply the concepts on your own. Maybe you're a social animal craving group accountability, or maybe you wish you could raise your hand and ask questions midway through a chapter.

Well, you're in luck! My patrons and I have been hanging out on Saturday mornings preparing a seven-week virtual workshop that promises to be super helpful and validating and -- their words not mine -- worth setting an alarm and getting up early for!

So far we've shared our own real-life experiences, answered questions, and even done some Zoom show-and-tell to celebrate organizing and decluttering successes. If you know, you know: sometimes those small wins mean everything to us. It's lovely to be part of a group who gets it.

Keep an eye on this email in for information about two workshop sessions in the fall:
* Thursday evenings at 7:30 p.m. Eastern, September 2 - October 14
* Saturday mornings at 9:30 a.m. Eastern, starting September 11 - October 30

Registration will open in August. Subscribers to this email will receive a discount on your registration. If you answered my interest survey last fall, look for a special email with an additional discount!

** Get new posts by email! **

I subscribe to over 100 podcasts and have a feed reader bursting with blogs. I collect everything that catches my eye, which means I can't keep up with it all.

When I really, really don't want to miss something, I ask for it in my email.

If that sounds like you too, you can subscribe to receive new ADHD Homestead blog posts via email!

I've always offered this option. However, doing some IT housekeeping this month I realized I rarely talk about it!

** A little help? **

Y'all have really come through with reviews of Order from Chaos on Goodreads and Amazon. These reviews help new readers discover the book -- and my reader emails tell me they appreciate the discovery! If you've checked out the Order from Chaos audiobook, please take a moment to leave a review on Audible: https://www.audible.com/pd/Order-from-Chaos-Audiobook/1666126446
