Dear [FIRST_NAME/friends],

I had something a little heavier written for this letter, but then I posted on Instagram about the useless 100-dollar bill in my wallet.

It’s a Canadian bill, left over from last summer’s vacation. I (sadly) have no plan to return to Canada. I also have no plan to exchange the bill for US currency. Therein lies the problem.

Over the past seven months I’ve encountered several situations where I needed cash (USD) but had none. I finally half-solved that problem earlier this month: I put a huge restaurant tab on my credit card and some of the people at our table paid me back in cash.

However, I’m still carrying around 75-ish dollars of perfectly good money I can’t use.

I’m rolling my eyes now but there was a time when something like this—something that seemed silly but also emblematic of all my failures—would’ve sent me into a doom-spiral of self-loathing. It’s called emotional hyperfocus (https://adhdhomestead.net/valley-of-the-shadow-of-emotional-hyperfocus/), and it sucks.

Perhaps the biggest and best lesson I’ve learned over the years is that I can’t sit and cry and berate myself until I feel worthless over this stuff. It happens to all of us, more often than we’d like, and no ADHDer can withstand a lifetime on that emotional rollercoaster.

Plus, it’s not going to solve the problem. What I really need to do is take my own advice and create a project in Do The Thing (https://dothething.app/) called “exchange Canadian bill for US dollars.”

It just feels silly for something so stupid to require that much overhead.

Last month when I was interviewed for a program on our local public radio station, the host told me she didn’t think she’d be able to maintain all the organizational systems I do. It really was, as my book subtitle said, a daily grind. How did I reconcile that daily grind with the fact that ADHDers struggle so much with busy work?

This is how. Because it’s the only way certain tasks will ever get done. As the past seven-plus months have shown, I simply will not exchange foreign currency from my summer vacation without creating a project within my task management infrastructure. Yes, it’s literally a project: something that requires more than one step to complete.

I don’t do the daily grind for fun, or because I inherently enjoy administrative tasks. I do it because otherwise my life is a complete mess. For those who don’t need to spend their time and energy this way, I salute you. I’ll also never be you 😂

Yours in solidarity for the daily grind,
Jaclyn

New post drafts available for preview and Q&A!

I've been having fun experimenting with Patreon and other ways to keep The ADHD Homestead ad-free (https://www.jaclynpaul.com/my-newly-ad-free-online-platform-almost-five-months-in/). My favorite experiment thus far has been my post previews. Whenever I finish a rough draft of a new post, I share it on the ADHD Homestead Patreon 😊

Patrons can comment on these drafts and ask questions before they’re published on the blog—something I’m really excited to incorporate into my writing process. I love having an opportunity to give patrons a peek behind the scenes and invite feedback that will make the blog better for everyone.

If you aren't a patron yet, you can join the fun for as little as $1 per month at https://patreon.com/ADHDHomestead

If Patreon isn't your thing but you want to support the site anyway, you can keep it simple and just buy me a coffee 😉 (https://adhdhomestead.net/#coffee)

I love an underdog, so I'm always secretly rooting for another post to unseat time blindness as a fan favorite on my blog or social media. This month one did! Unsurprisingly, it's about social skills, another big ADHD pain point.
